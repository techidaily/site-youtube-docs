FLII Selfie Ring Light</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-selfie-ring-light.jpg"                      alt="FLII Selfie Ring Light"                ></p><p>As much as smartphone camera technology has advanced, phone cameras still underperform when it comes to filming video in low-light. In low-light, your footage is very grainy because your phone is equipped with a small camera sensor, an engineering choice by the manufacturers to keep the size of the phone small. A handy accessory that you can use to get more light is the FLII selfie ring light. This ring light clamps onto your phone and emits a neutral white light. You can clamp this light to either side of your phone, depending on whether you want to use your rear-facing camera or your front-facing camera. This selfie ring light sells for around $16 USD.</p><h3 id="5-RODE-VideoMic-Me"><a href="#5-RODE-VideoMic-Me" class="headerlink" title="5. RODE VideoMic Me"></a>5. RODE VideoMic Me</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-microphone.jpg"                      alt="RODE VideoMic Me"                ></p><p>The mic that is already built into your phone is equally sensitive to the sounds that come from behind the phone as it is to the sounds that are in front of the phone. This can be problematic when you’re trying to vlog in selfie mode while there’s a loud concert on the other side. One smartphone accessory that can improve the sound that you record from your phone in these situations is the RODE VideoMic Me. This mini directional shotgun mic plugs right into your phone’s headphone jack and sells for around $60 USD. In windy conditions, the dead cat windshield that it comes with does a great job of minimizing noise from the wind. In quiet, indoor conditions where you are the only person speaking, this device performs no better than your phone’s internal microphone. Your phone will also have to be in airplane mode to prevent the Rode VideoMic Me from recording unwanted clicking noise caused by background processes performed by your phone. So you wouldn’t want to use this for livestreaming.</p><h3 id="6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set"><a href="#6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set" class="headerlink" title="6.

The 3-in-1 set comes with a wide-angle lens, a fisheye lens, and a macro lens. The clamp it comes with is long enough for these lenses to reach any camera on a smartphone, not just those of iPhones which are positioned close to the phone’s outer edge. To get the most out of these lenses, you’ll have to use them without your phone’s protective case on. Although you are free to use this lens set on either your phone’s rear-facing camera or front-facing camera, the metal housing of these lenses is likely to show up in your footage when you use them with your front-facing camera. So, instead of having your recorded image stretch to the ends of a 16:9 ratio rectangular frame, your recorded image will look as if it is contained inside a circle. This lens set sells for around $30 USD.</p><h3 id="7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone"><a href="#7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone"></a>7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-iographer-go.jpg"                      alt="iOgrapher Go"                ></p><p>There’s many more accessories that you can take advantage of if you don’t limit yourself to just smartphone camera accessories. Sound and lighting equipment made for stand-alone cameras perform much better too. Many of these accessories are meant to connect to the camera “shoe” (a bracket on top of the camera that accessories can be attached to). Smartphones don’t come with these kinds of shoes. So, to take advantage of these higher quality accessories, you’ll need some kind of camera rig for your smartphone that also comes with shoes. The iOgrapher Go offers this at around $60 USD. This accessory comes with three shoes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System"><a href="#8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System" class="headerlink" title="8.

This system also comes with three shoes. An advantage the TwistGrip System has over the iOgrapher Go is that it is much more portable. Its three connected parts can be detached to take up less space in your bag. This system sells for around $50 USD.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Zhiyun-Smooth-Q-3-Axis-Handheld-Gimbal-Stabilizer-for-Smartphones"><a href="#9-Zhiyun-Smooth-Q-3-Axis-Handheld-Gimbal-Stabilizer-for-Smartphones" class="headerlink" title="9.

This gimbal is very effective in helping you record smooth video. Using the app that it comes with, you can even preset this gimbal to smoothly pan and rotate from a starting position to an ending position, giving you the opportunity to film beautiful time lapses.

In our guide, you will find an answer to this, along with related queries like how YouTube highlighted comment works, the removal process, its benefits, and more.</p><p>If you own a YouTube channel or are starting one, even you can do this. Without further ado, let’s jump straight into the core of YouTube’s highlighted comments. We’ve categorized this article into a total of 8 parts for simple and better understanding.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Does Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: What Does Highlighted Comments Look Like on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make Comment Highlighted?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Highlighted Comments URL?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Reply to Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment</a></li><li><a href="#part8">Part 8: Benefits of Highlighted Comments</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-The-Highlighted-Comment-Mean-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?"></a>Part 1: What Does The Highlighted Comment Mean On YouTube?</h2><p>Before you get on with highlighting your comments, you must understand what it means exactly. You may follow comments on the videos posted by several YouTubers, but the highlighted ones are always making it to the top of the list.</p><p>Having said that, neither the content creator nor users or moderators choose to highlight YouTube comments to begin with. They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links. The 2 URLs lead you to the same video, but only one of them shows a highlighted comment.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Notice the name “lc” in the first URL- that stands for linked comment. YouTube might include this additional parameter.

The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously).

The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial. That is especially true if you are looking for ways to optimize your channel.</p><p>YouTube is undeniably the second largest search engine on the web. Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel. If your comment gets highlighted, your YouTube channel can be one of them.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>YouTube can be an intimidating tool for marketing and more so for newcomers. Every YouTuber wishes that their channel performs better than the previous day. Even though the highlighted comment or highlighted reply feature doesn’t have any direct benefits, it can indeed help in optimizing your YouTube channel.</p><p>It can connect you with potential viewers and increase the number of people that visit your channel regularly. However, how many of them stay and hit the “Subscribe” button is a different story altogether and is wholly based on whether they like what you share through your videos.</p><p>In this article, we have shared facts on YouTube’s commonly seen highlighted comment feature. Yet, the term is a heavily misleading one, as far as viewers and Youtuber’s are concerned. We have also covered all other aspects and queries related to this term.

We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-2017.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Summit Group Photo"                ></p><p><em>Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit.

A map of Dumbo"></a>1. A map of Dumbo</h2><p>The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.</p><p><em>Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo.</em></p><p>Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’.

Post Cards</h2><p>One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135316/14409" target="_top" id="2135316">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135316" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135316/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-S’well-bottle"><a href="#3-S’well-bottle" class="headerlink" title="3.

So if you are looking for your own voice, but you’re not really sure where to start, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we are going to show you how to make attention-grabbing YouTube videos that are going to attract a huge audience.</p><ul><li><a href="#YouTubePreparationStage">Preparation Stage for Making YouTube Video [4 Aspects You Should Consider] </a></li><li><a href="#YouTubeRecording">Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video [5 Tips and Tricks] </a></li><li><a href="#YouTubeEditingtips">YouTube Video Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</a></li><li><a href="#YouTubeuploading">Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</a></li><li><a href="#YouTubevideoediting">How to Make YouTube Videos from a Mac or PC Computer?

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p><h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p><p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p><p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p><h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p><p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p><h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p><h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p><h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p><h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p><h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p><p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105859/7443" target="_top" id="2105859">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105859" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105859/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p><p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p><p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p><p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p><p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p><h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed.

However, the list had changed after 2020 due to the rise of a catchy kid song - Baby Shark Dance. This child song video has reached more than 9 billion views worldwide (still growing) and led to an online dancing fever - Body Shark Challenge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100530/7443" target="_top" id="2100530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-Most-Watched-YouTube-Videos-in-2021"><a href="#Top-10-Most-Watched-YouTube-Videos-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Videos in 2021"></a>Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Videos in 2021</h2><p>You may have expected this, but the majority of the most popular YouTube videos are actually music videos. Most, but not all. Here’s our list based on the latest statistics about the most viewed youtube video ever available right now. If you want to know more about the channels or the YouTubers, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get the details of them.</p><p>Here is a full list of the most viewed videos on YouTube except for Body Shark Dance.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft.

Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee"></a>1. Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee</h4><p> <strong>Views:5.4B</strong></p><p>Despacito, the Spanish word for ‘slowly’, has broken all records in terms of the most viewed YouTube videos, reaching the milestone of two billion views faster than any other video, ever. It went on to reach 2.5 billion views faster than any other and now boasts more than five billion views, making it the most-watched YouTube video of all time.</p><p>As a song that’s almost completely sung in Spanish, the immense popularity of this video surprised everyone. Although hugely popular in Hispanic countries, Despacito was also top of the charts in 45 different countries, from Uruguay to Japan to Italy, so what made it so popular? Experts have speculated that its mix of Caribbean, Latin, pop, and rap gave it a broad appeal. Its earwormish nature, danceable beat, and perfectly summery vibe have propelled this fairly mediocre video to the heights of YouTube stardom that the rest of us can only dream about.</p><h4 id="2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth"><a href="#2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth" class="headerlink" title="2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth"></a>2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p><p>See You Again is a pretty cool song but is it really cool enough to be number two of the most-watched YouTube videos? Sure, the tune is catchy, and the video production is probably better than that of Despacito, but its rapid rise to YouTube stardom was still rather unexpected. Over 800 days after release, the video had clocked up almost three billion views, unseating the reigning champion of YouTube views, Psy and his K-Pop masterpiece, Gangnam Style, and today it’s sitting comfortably in the number two spot with 3.6 billion watches.</p><p>So, why did this tune go so viral? Was it the loyal Fast and the Furious fan base craving more time with the <em>Furious 7</em> soundtrack, or was it the tributary nature of the video paying homage to the late Paul Walker that was bringing in the views? In truth, it was probably both and also neither. The main influencer here was simply that a lot more people were using YouTube. Between 2015 and 2016, YouTube experienced a 17 percent increase in music video viewers and a total 25 percent increase in video streams. See You Again was simply in the right place at the right time.</p><h4 id="3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran"><a href="#3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran" class="headerlink" title="3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran"></a>3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p><p>If there’s one artist who has rocked the music scene more than any other in recent years, Mr. Sheeran is it. His double lead single from his latest album ÷ (divide) has been his most successful to date, racking up 3.5 billion views on YouTube to date with millions more added each day. It is Spotify’s most popular song ever with 1.5 billion streams and currently holds the record for the most number of weeks spent in the Billboard top 10. It’s was nominated for best single at the Brit Awards 2021 but was pipped at the post by Rag’n’Bone Man with Human.</p><p>But why does everyone love Shape of You so much? It’s a pretty simple song, with four basic chords and fairly boring romantic lyrics; what makes it so special? Some of its success is down to the physical construction of the music itself, with a pentatonic scale offering a tried and tested catchiness that’s impossible to resist. Even if you’re not a Sheeran fan, exposure has made this song familiar to you, being popular in clubs, pubs, restaurants and with buskers on street corners (not to mention certain Christmas adverts, right?). Add to all this the rise in general popularity of music videos, it’s clear to see how it’s become one of the most viewed YouTube videos of all time.</p><h4 id="4-Gangnam-Style-Psy"><a href="#4-Gangnam-Style-Psy" class="headerlink" title="4. Gangnam Style - Psy"></a>4. Gangnam Style - Psy</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p><p>We’d be surprised if you could honestly say you’d never heard of Gangnam Style (and perhaps secretly tried a few horse dance moves), and Psy himself was undoubtedly pretty surprised too when he rocketed to internet fame in 2013. At its peak, this K-Pop legend was racking up 72 views per second and averaged 33 views a second for two whole years. Today, he’s fourth on the list with a total of 3.2 billion views (and yes, people are still watching).</p><p>Although it might seem Psy was inherently lucky when his song became such a huge hit, actually what he did was very clever. As well as combining a catchy tune with a ridiculously funny video, he intentionally left copyright off the video itself, almost inviting others to create their own parodies of the video, which they did in their droves. The dance he created was nothing short of genius, easily replicable by others all over the world. Despite being ‘K-Pop’, Psy’s own look is a world away from the polished pretty boy image of other artists in this genre, offering more of an anti-pop image from a guy who is clearly comfortable in his own skin. The result is the full package of measures, and deservedly places Gangnam Style in the top 10 most-watched YouTube videos of all time.</p><h4 id="5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies"><a href="#5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies" class="headerlink" title="5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies"></a>5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p><p>A rather unusual entry for our number five slot, Masha and the Bear, as you might have guessed, is not a music video at all. It’s not even an official video, and to top it off it’s in Russian! Masha and the Bear is incredibly popular in Russia and is based loosely on an old Russian folk story, and since all 68 episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, three have surpassed the one billion view mark.</p><p>This particular episode is the crowning glory, having racked up 3.1 billion views over the years. The reason for this particular episode’s incredibly popularity is not entirely clear, although it is thought that perhaps the way Masha herself is portrayed has helped its success. Dressed in a folk costume with no legs on show and a headscarf makes the video acceptable to Muslim audiences around the world, which may have helped to spread its popularity.</p><h4 id="6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars"><a href="#6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars" class="headerlink" title="6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars"></a>6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p><p>Also with 3.1 billion views, the inimitably catchy Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson has been his biggest hit to date. Boasting chart-topping success in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and many other locations around the world, the single won two Grammys, record of the year, and spent 14 weeks at number one in the US. So, what was it that got people watching, singing, and dancing along with Ronson and Mars?</p><p>Part of the success is undoubtedly down to the amazing lyrics of the song. From repeating how hot he is to namechecking Michelle Pfeiffer and Saint Laurent, these are feel-good power lyrics at their very best. The simple four-chord structure and effortlessly funky beat help its appeal bridge the generations, and the video itself just screams fun, fun, fun! Don’t believe us, just watch (the YouTube video, of course)!</p><h4 id="7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber"><a href="#7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber" class="headerlink" title="7. Sorry - Justin Bieber"></a>7. Sorry - Justin Bieber</h4><p> <strong>Views:3 B</strong></p><p>It’s no surprise that the young person’s sensation that is Justin Bieber had to make an appearance in our top 10 most-watched YouTube videos. He is, after all, the epitome of the YouTube generation, and has plenty of other well-watched videos in his archives. Selling 10 million copies in 2016 alone and topping the charts in 13 countries, Sorry has racked up, to date, 2.9 billion hits on YouTube, making it his most successful music video ever. So, what was the secret to this hit’s success?</p><p>Actually, we think that the reason for the success of this particular Bieber creation is due in part to the mismatch between the visuals and the audio. A languishing video requesting redemption from a lover would typically be shot in gritty black and white and feature the singer moping about feeling sorry for themselves. Instead, Bieber opted to recruit lively dancers from New Zealand’s ReQuest Dance Crew and furnish them with eye-popping outfits and lively dance moves to make up for the potentially depressing lyrics.</p><h4 id="8-Sugar-Maroon-5"><a href="#8-Sugar-Maroon-5" class="headerlink" title="8. Sugar - Maroon 5"></a>8. Sugar - Maroon 5</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.7B</strong></p><p>Maroon 5 had enjoyed a somewhat tumultuous career, achieving fame in the noughties, disappearing for a while, and then returning with outstanding hits such as ‘moves like Jagger’ and ‘One more night’. But this song, Sugar, has been their biggest video hit to date. Why? Well, the proof is in the pudding as they say.</p><p>This was a completely new concept video, shot in a variety of locations around Los Angeles and featuring Maroon 5 crashing numerous weddings. The reality is that the band did arrange things somewhat with the groom, although the bride and her guests had no idea. The resulting video is a joy to watch, as the assembled wedding parties express their shock, surprise, fear, and even anger as Levine and his crew pitch up and start singing.</p><p>Looking for the best wedding video songs?

Shake It Off - Taylor Swift"></a>9. Shake It Off - Taylor Swift</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p><p>After a long drought of almost a year, devoted fans of Taylor Swift were sick to death of hearing ‘I Knew you were Trouble’ on the radio five hundred times a day, so Shake it Off was almost guaranteed to be a big hit. Going straight into number one on the charts and staying in the Hot 100 for 50 consecutive weeks, its success on YouTube was even greater, boasting 2.5 billion views to date and making it the 9th most-watched video on YouTube. But how?</p><p>Swift is a master of generating internet attention. With over 100 million Instagram followers, Taylor set about whipping her ‘Little Monsters’ into a frenzy about the forthcoming release of her new single. As a result, Shake it Off was pretty much all the internet cared about for a full 24 hours. The lyrics tread a thin line between playful mockery of Swift and self-aware empowerment but are also super easy to memories and sing along with. Well played madam, well played.</p><h4 id="10-Roar-Katy-Perry"><a href="#10-Roar-Katy-Perry" class="headerlink" title="10. Roar - Katy Perry"></a>10. Roar - Katy Perry</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p><p>In 2013, Katy Perry took a short break out of kissing girls and liking it, as well as marrying (and divorcing) Russell Brand in order to release this banging new single. By the end of the year, Roar had sold almost 10 million copies and had topped the charts in 12 different countries. Its success on the radio was only surpassed by the success of the colorful music video on YouTube, where it has secured 2.5 billion views to date.</p><p>What’s not to love about this particular video, we ask? The lyrics are super empowering, you can run to it, dance to it, or just belt out your own roar alongside Katy. The visuals are awesome too, in particular the CGI animals and skimpy leopard print bikini, which undoubtedly helped its popularity. In a year that was tough personally for Perry, she hit back and produced this powerful song, showing once again that she is indeed a champion.</p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>All the videos listed above have billions of views after it is on YouTube, however, Rome wasn’t built in a day.

It was launched in February 2005 and today it is serving like one of the biggest social media network. This platform was actually designed by few creative PayPal workers.</p><p><strong>Dailymotion:</strong> It is a French social site and one popular competitor against YouTube. This site was launched by Orange on 15th March, 2005. You can watch wide range of videos on Dailymotion but for limited duration of time.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion"><a href="#Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion</h2><p> Here we few key terms that can help you to understand difference between YouTube and Dailymotion:</p><h4 id="1-Numbers"><a href="#1-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="1.Numbers"></a>1.Numbers</h4><p> The total number of viewers that interact with site like Dailymotion and YouTube is actually one of the important parameter for business because it decides the number of video ads and text that will be placed on site. We all know that YouTube is world’s biggest network for videos and Dailymotion follows it at second number. Statistics reveal that there are so many advantages of YouTube over Dailymotion, especially in terms of total site visitors as YouTube gets billions of visitors per month but this count is limited to 112 million visitors in case of Dailymotion.</p><h4 id="2-3D-Videos"><a href="#2-3D-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.3D Videos"></a>2.3D Videos</h4><p> 3D videos are one of the biggest needs of viewers these days so its availability on site definitely boosts site importance in market. As YouTube is developed with Beta so it is capable enough to provide impressive 3D viewing experience to viewers but on the other side, Dailymotion lacks behind in this capability. You cannot enjoy 3D content on Dailymotion screens.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Quality"><a href="#3-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3.Video Quality"></a>3.Video Quality</h4><p> One more important criterion for comparison between YouTube and Dailymotion is the overall allowed time limit for video uploads. In case of Dailymotion, you will often find all videos with less than 60 minute duration but on YouTube, video can be of any big length as it never poses any restriction on the basis of time duration. Here is one wonderful thing to know that on YouTube videos of worth 72 hour duration are uploaded per second. And viewers in YouTube are capable enough to watch fresh videos day and night.</p><p> Sadly, Dailymotion cannot give you this much freedom about content and naturally here YouTube again stays on advantageous side for users. May be this is the biggest reason behind billions of having visitors on YouTube platform as compared to only 112 million visitors over Dailymotion.</p><h4 id="4-Analytics"><a href="#4-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="4.Analytics"></a>4.Analytics</h4><p> You might be aware about the fact that YouTube is owned by Behemoth Google; that is why it possesses most robust analytics tools as like YouTube insights. With these advanced tools, businesses as well as individuals can monitor their viewers on videos. They can also make analysis about how long and how often a particular visitor stays on videos. It helps businesses to improve their video content so that more visitors can be attracted. Dailymotion cannot offer you such details, here you can access just publication date of video, nothing else. The true fact is that Dailymotion itself has a YouTube channel that users often access to upload multiple videos so that Dailymotion can avail some promotions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880927/19272" target="_top" id="1880927">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880927" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880927/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Editing-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Videos"><a href="#Tips-for-Editing-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos"></a>Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos</h2><p> If you often watch, download or upload videos on YouTube and Dailymotion platform then you may also need to edit them time to time.

It is generally added to video titles and descriptions or used independently. They make YouTubers easily discover other posts with similar tags. YouTube tags are vital as they help the YouTube algorithm fully understand the videos you post. It’s by this that those who are interested in your video get hooked to them.</p><p>For tags to work ideally, you need to include your brand-specific tags before adding similar tags. YouTube auto-suggest is another gem in this scenario. Just see what YouTube suggests when you type while searching other similar topics. For great results, place the most important keywords and tags first, as these will act as the face of your video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-will-YouTube-tag-affect-your-video-performance"><a href="#How-will-YouTube-tag-affect-your-video-performance" class="headerlink" title="How will YouTube tag affect your video performance?"></a>How will YouTube tag affect your video performance?</h2><p>It is YouTube tags that help viewers to find videos they are searching for on YouTube. Besides, this is how it works: An audience will type keywords into YouTube’s search bar. Then videos with the same tag and keywords will appear in the search results. If not correctly done, the YouTube tag could affect your video performance and lead to such outcomes.</p><h4 id="1-No-adequate-audience-engagement"><a href="#1-No-adequate-audience-engagement" class="headerlink" title="1.

A small mistake, and you lose track. It is wise to know the best approach to use your tags. Improper YouTube tagging will not drive enough audience to your channel. You, therefore, won’t get adequate audience engagement.</p><h4 id="2-Your-video-won’t-go-viral"><a href="#2-Your-video-won’t-go-viral" class="headerlink" title="2. Your video won’t go viral"></a>2.

It gives you exactly the same kind of control over your smartphone camera as you would have over a DSLR. You can manually adjust your focus, exposure, ISO, shutter speed, tint, and color temperature. There are even voice processing audio filters, so you can capture better audio while you’re shooting and have less to fix in post.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Because mobile cameras already perform so well, it can be easy to think to have more to adjust would only make things more complicated. However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload

Afterwards, you need to go to the “My Channel” option and click on the “Video Manager”.</p><p> Upon doing this, a new page is going to pop up, and you are going to see a list of all the videos that you’ve uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-video-basic-description-3.jpg"                      alt="Video list"                ></p><p> There are little tick boxes on the left side which you can click in order to mark. Mark the videos that you want to edit and click on the “Actions” button on top. There is going to be a drop-down menu, and you can click on the delete option to remove the video permanently. Furthermore, you can also hide the video if you don’t want to delete it but only to hide it away from your subscribers. In order to do so, you should simply click on the Private or Unlisted button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-remove-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="remove youtube videos"                ></p><p> That’s pretty much it – there’s nothing further to it, and the entire thing is rather comprehensive and easy to carry out, which makes it convenient to go through.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947750/11832" target="_top" id="947750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947750/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels"></a>Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels</h2><p> Now that we’ve covered how to remove videos from your own channel, it’s time to dig a little bit deeper. There are certain instances in which you might want to remove YouTube videos from other channels as well. The reasons for this are usually rather personal. For instance – someone has uploaded a video including you or something yours without your consent, and this harms your reputation. Furthermore, it may display sensitive information that you don’t want to reveal to anyone else – the reasons are rather different, but they are related to your own individual privacy which is an important legal right.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Blur Faces in YouTube Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The first thing you can do is contact the person who uploaded the video and kindly asks him to remove it using the procedure that we described above. This is going to be the best choice because it’s going to achieve the result quickly and without any hassle. However, in certain cases, the person might not be active, or he might disagree with you and keep the video posted. If that’s the case, you have one option which is likely to be the best alternative.</p><p> You need to report the video as an inappropriate and flag it with the remark that it’s invading your privacy. This is going to lead you to the page of the YouTube Safety Center. You will have to explain the issue in details in a six-step wizard which extensively asks you about how the video is invasive to your privacy rights. The process is quite comprehensive, and it’s easy to go through. However, you will have to wait for the YouTube support team to assess it and make the decision for the removal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="remove other&#39;s youtube videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918661/19272" target="_top" id="1918661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918661/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The truth is that being able to remove YouTube videos is something important that you should be able to do.

Making a YouTube video isn’t much different than making any other type of short or feature film as you have to go through the same stages of the video production process. Everything, including creating YouTube videos starts with an idea, so let’s take a look at the steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording your first YouTube video.</p><h4 id="1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#1-Start-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1. Start a YouTube Channel"></a>1. Start a YouTube Channel</h4><p>The journey towards success begins with seemingly small and insignificant steps. Creating a YouTube channel is exactly that, a step, without which you won’t be able to become a YouTuber. All you have to do in order to create a channel on YouTube is sign in to the platform using your Google account and then head over to the Settings menu. Click on the Create a new channel option and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick a name for your Brand channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dedicate some extra time to the process of selecting a name for the channel, because that is the first thing your potential followers are going to notice. The platform lets you start as many as fifty channels with one Gmail ID, and as your channels grow, you can add multiple managers to each channel you’ve started. Click on the Create button when you’re done and that’s it you’re now a proud owner of a YouTube channel.</p><p>We have summarized some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tips and tricks for creating a YouTube channel account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hope that will help you to create a channel more easily.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy"><a href="#2-Choose-a-Niche-and-Craft-a-Video-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy"></a>2. Choose a Niche and Craft a Video Content Strategy</h4><p>Devising a plan before you start producing content you are going to share on YouTube is going to give you a sense of direction, since there are so many different types of videos that can attract a large audience. Try to imagine your ideal YouTube follower, and then think about what they are interested in or how you can generate value for them through the content you post on your channel. Attempting to cover a broad spectrum of topics usually doesn’t produce the best results, so instead, you should focus on a specific subject and do your best to offer a unique perspective to your viewers on that subject. More importantly, you need to choose the themes for your videos that are relevant to the audience you would like to reach. Gaming, tutorials, beauty or comedy videos are just a few of the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, although which niche you’re going to pick ultimately depends on your personal interests and reasons why you chose to become a YouTuber in the first place.</p><p>Additionally, you should follow the hottest trends on the Internet so that you can find out which topics are drawing the most attention at the moment. Don’t let all these questions trouble you, simply <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >choose a niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in which you feel the most comfortable in and start shooting. Keep a watchful eye on how your followers respond to the videos you share on your channel as time goes on and remain open to new ideas or collaborations.</p><h4 id="3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#3-Secure-a-Fresh-Supply-of-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas"></a>3. Secure a Fresh Supply of YouTube Video Ideas</h4><p>Defining your niche is just a beginning because you have to keep producing your videos at a steady pace. Most YouTube experts say that sharing new content at least once a week is necessary if you want to gather a large group of followers on your channel. Consequently, you’ll need a constant supply of ideas for new videos that cover topics your audience is interested in. A simple search on YouTube can help you discover the videos on the platform that have the most views. This should give you a pretty good idea which types of videos are the most popular at the moment and what viewers want to see the most.</p><p>Reading the comments section below a YouTube video can be a great way to discover new ideas since viewers often ask questions or search for advice on very specific aspects of the topic that particular video is covering. Moreover, YouTube isn’t the only destination on the Internet where you can find inspiration for your next video since there are countless groups and communities where you can come across interesting topics for your next video.</p><h4 id="4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment"><a href="#4-Get-the-Right-Video-and-Audio-Recording-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment"></a>4. Get the Right Video and Audio Recording Equipment</h4><p>The list of audio and video recording gear you’re going to need to create a YouTube video depends on the type of video you’re trying to make. Gamers who want to record gameplay and post it on their YouTube channel only need a screen capturing software or a capture card and a microphone. The list of equipment is a bit longer for YouTubers interested in the production of vlogs, comedy or review videos since they are going to need a camera or a Smartphone capable of recording videos at high resolutions, lighting equipment, tripods, steady cams, microphones. If you would like to learn more about the pieces of equipment you are going to need while recording a YouTube video, check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Video Shooting Equipment List <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Production-Stage-Recording-a-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video"></a>Production Stage: Recording a YouTube Video</h2><p>After you’ve successfully completed the preparation stage it is time to start getting ready for the next step of the process of making a YouTube video. However, you can’t just pick up a camera and start randomly shooting unrelated scenes, instead, you should follow the steps below that make the production of a video much less complicated.</p><h4 id="1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule"><a href="#1-Write-a-Script-and-Make-a-Shooting-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule"></a>1. Write a Script and Make a Shooting Schedule</h4><p>Write down all of your ideas for your next video prior to shooting the first shot of that video. A script can be particularly useful if the video you’re planning on making involves a lot of narration since you’ll always know what to say next. Furthermore, you don’t have to record the entire video on the same day, and you have the freedom to plan when and where you are going to record each scene you want to include in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Set-a-Scene"><a href="#2-Set-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Set a Scene"></a>2. Set a Scene</h4><p>You control what the viewers of your YouTube video are going to see. That’s why you have to choose your shooting locations carefully and to hand-pick each prop that is going to be visible in the shot. Avoid shooting in messy rooms, because the items in the background are going to distract the viewer and reduce the quality of your videos.</p><h4 id="3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions"><a href="#3-Pick-the-Best-Camera-Positions" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick the Best Camera Positions"></a>3. Pick the Best Camera Positions</h4><p>Once you know where and when you are going to shoot your video, you should start planning your shots. Most YouTube videos are recorded from a single camera position, but you can also experiment with different shot angles if it helps you to tell the story of the video. Don’t put the actors near direct sources of light like windows or lamps because if you do so you can easily end up ruining the shot.</p><h4 id="4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot"><a href="#4-Make-Sure-that-You-Have-Enough-Light-in-The-Shot" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot"></a>4. Make Sure that You Have Enough Light in The Shot</h4><p>Natural sources of light are often not enough to light a scene properly, because the amount of available light you’ll have at your disposal can change in a few minutes. That’s why nearly all YouTubers use lighting kits that enable them to control the amount of light in the shot at any moment.</p><h4 id="5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera"><a href="#5-Bonus-Making-YouTube-Videos-Without-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera"></a>5. Bonus: Making YouTube Videos Without a Camera</h4><p>In case using video and audio recording equipment is a bit too technical for you, there is a simple alternative solution since you can capture all activities on your computer’s screen with software products such as Filmora or OBS Studio. This is an excellent option for gamers who want to record gameplay of their favorite video games or skilled educators that would like to share their knowledge and show others how to use a piece of software or perform any other computer-based task.</p><p>Besides screencasting, you can also assemble existing footage from old TV shows, movies or cartoons to make a YouTube video. You don’t have to worry about copyright infringements, as long as the footage you’re using is within the public domain. However, if you accidentally end up using footage without permission it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to file a lawsuit, but your video may be removed from your YouTube channel if someone reports that you’ve used footage without the permission from its owners.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398455/3022" target="_top" id="398455">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398455" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398455/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded"><a href="#Postproduction-Stage-Editing-the-Footage-You-Recorded" class="headerlink" title="Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded"></a>Postproduction Stage: Editing the Footage You Recorded</h2><p>Before you can share the video clips you recorded with a camera, Smartphone or a screencasting software, you should edit them first. Choosing video editing software isn’t always easy since there are so many different options that enable you to perform both basic and advanced video editing tasks. You can check our recommendations about some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best video editing software for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> videos, in case you are still looking for a video editor that is best suited for the price range you’ve had in mind or your skill level. You should choose a video editing app that you feel the most comfortable using since you are going to spend a lot of time editing videos with it.</p><p>The video editing techniques you will utilize during the process of piecing together a YouTube video depend on a number of factors that range from the genre of the video to its visual style. However, <strong>trimming or cutting the footage</strong>, <strong>creating opening titles</strong> and <strong>end credits</strong> are among the most common video editing actions you will have to perform on each new project. Mastering these basic video editing techniques is essential for the success of your videos on YouTube since it will enable you to quickly trim a video clip by dragging one of its ends in an inward or outward direction or remove a portion of a clip you don’t want to feature in the final cut of the video from the timeline.</p><p>Hard cuts can at times disrupt the flow of a video, but you can easily fix this by <strong>adding a transition</strong> between two clips. What’s more, nearly all video editing software products on the market come bundled with rich <strong>visual and audio effects</strong> libraries that make the color grading or audio editing process much faster. Adding <strong>opening titles, lower thirds or any other image overlay</strong> can help you introduce the characters in the video to the audience, inform the audience about important aspects of the topic you’re covering or summarize the key points of the video.</p><p><strong>Creating a soundtrack</strong> is also a vital step of the video editing process that largely influences the quality of the final video. That’s why the narration or the dialogues must be recorded professionally since even the slightest background noise can distract the viewer. Whether or not you are going to <strong>add music to a video</strong>, depends on the type of project you’re working on. Video editing software products like Filmora have their own <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offer songs from Rock or Electronic and numerous other genres.</p><p>When you complete the video editing process, you should export the video to a folder on your hard drive or directly to your YouTube channel if the video editing app you’ve chosen provides that option. How long the rendering of a video is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power, video’s length, and the output resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Adding-Uploading-Videos-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel"></a>Adding&#x2F;Uploading Videos to Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>As we already noted you can either <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload a video to YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> directly from a video editing software or from a hard drive after the rendering process is completed.

Creating a video in Filmora doesn’t require a developed set of video editing skills, since all of the tools and options the editor offers are remarkably easy to use.</p><p>When you are ready to start a new project you should simply launch the software, and once the new project loads, you should head over to the File menu and select the Project Settings option that lets you <strong>set the resolution, aspect ratio and the frame rate of the video.</strong> Proceed to import the footage into the project by selecting one of the available options in the Import drop-down menu or by simply dragging the media assets from a folder on your hard drive and dropping them to the Filmora’s Media Panel. In case you don’t have your own audio and video footage you can download videos, music, visual and audio effects from a stock footage website like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmstock effects store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Filmora offers <strong>rich transitions and visual effects libraries</strong> you can use to make the cuts between shot smoother or enhance the colors in the video clips you’re editing. Furthermore, the editor lets you <strong>take snapshots of any frame in video clips</strong> you’ve placed on the timeline in a single click which can be quite useful if you want to create a thumbnail for your YouTube video.
