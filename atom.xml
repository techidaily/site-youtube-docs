Your computer will not show up as an option if you do not have Reflector running.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Above are the screen and video recording software programs that we picked up for you to make a YouTube tutorial, how-to or software review video on most popular platforms including Windows and Mac computer and Android and iOS smartphones.

They’re convenient and they draw the least amount of attention. But since most smartphones weren’t made specifically for vlogging, there’s a lot of room to make them more suitable for that purpose. Here is a list of the nine best smartphone camera accessories for vloggers.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Table of Contents 1. <a href="#portablecharger">PORTABLE CHARGER</a>2. <a href="#tripodmount">TRIPOD MOUNT</a>3. <a href="#antigravitycase">ANTI-GRAVITY CASE</a>4. <a href="#selfieringlight">SELFIE RING LIGHT</a>5. <a href="#directionalmic">DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE</a>6. <a href="#lensset">LENS SET</a>7. <a href="#filmmakingrig01">FILMMAKING RIG</a>8. <a href="#filmmakingrig02">FILMMAKING RIG</a>9. <a href="#gimbal">GIMBAL</a></th></tr></thead></table><h3 id="1-RAVPower-Portable-Charger"><a href="#1-RAVPower-Portable-Charger" class="headerlink" title="1. RAVPower Portable Charger"></a>1. RAVPower Portable Charger</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/best-smartphone-camera-accessories-portable-charger.jpg"                      alt="RAVPower Portable Charger"                ></p><p>Vlogging uses a lot more power. If you’re planning to vlog all throughout your day with your phone, you need a portable way to charge it back up. RAVPower has a great line up of portable chargers with multiple USB inputs that hold a total charge of more than 20,000 mAh. With that amount, you can fully charge your smartphone more than 6 times! I own one myself and it’s been great for me during my travels. A 22,000 mAh charger goes for about $42 USD.</p><h3 id="2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount"><a href="#2-Arkon-Tripod-Mount" class="headerlink" title="2. Arkon Tripod Mount"></a>2. Arkon Tripod Mount</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/best-smartphone-camera-accessories-tripod-mount.jpg"                      alt="Arkon Tripod Mount"                ></p><p>The Arkon tripod mount is a great portable tripod option that you can get at the fair price of around $20 USD. Not only does it have bendable legs, like the more expensive Joby GorillaPod tripod, that you can wrap around all kinds of structures, but it also comes with the smartphone mount, which Joby sells separately. Another great thing about the Arkon tripod is that its smartphone mount can be rotated so that you can position your phone to film in either widescreen or portrait mode.</p><h3 id="3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case"><a href="#3-Mega-Tiny-Anti-Gravity-Case" class="headerlink" title="3. Mega Tiny Anti-Gravity Case"></a>3. Mega Tiny Anti-Gravity Case</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-anti-gravity-case.jpg"                      alt="Mega Tiny Anti-Gravity Case"                ></p><p>For all the flat surfaces that the bendable legs of the Arkon tripod mount can’t wrap around, Mega Tiny’s anti-gravity cases will do the job of holding your iPhone or Android phone in one fixed position. These cases can stick to glass, mirrors, metal, and more. They range from $20 to $30 USD.</p><h3 id="4-FLII-Selfie-Ring-Light"><a href="#4-FLII-Selfie-Ring-Light" class="headerlink" title="4. FLII Selfie Ring Light"></a>4. FLII Selfie Ring Light</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-selfie-ring-light.jpg"                      alt="FLII Selfie Ring Light"                ></p><p>As much as smartphone camera technology has advanced, phone cameras still underperform when it comes to filming video in low-light. In low-light, your footage is very grainy because your phone is equipped with a small camera sensor, an engineering choice by the manufacturers to keep the size of the phone small. A handy accessory that you can use to get more light is the FLII selfie ring light. This ring light clamps onto your phone and emits a neutral white light. You can clamp this light to either side of your phone, depending on whether you want to use your rear-facing camera or your front-facing camera. This selfie ring light sells for around $16 USD.</p><h3 id="5-RODE-VideoMic-Me"><a href="#5-RODE-VideoMic-Me" class="headerlink" title="5. RODE VideoMic Me"></a>5. RODE VideoMic Me</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-microphone.jpg"                      alt="RODE VideoMic Me"                ></p><p>The mic that is already built into your phone is equally sensitive to the sounds that come from behind the phone as it is to the sounds that are in front of the phone. This can be problematic when you’re trying to vlog in selfie mode while there’s a loud concert on the other side. One smartphone accessory that can improve the sound that you record from your phone in these situations is the RODE VideoMic Me. This mini directional shotgun mic plugs right into your phone’s headphone jack and sells for around $60 USD. In windy conditions, the dead cat windshield that it comes with does a great job of minimizing noise from the wind. In quiet, indoor conditions where you are the only person speaking, this device performs no better than your phone’s internal microphone. Your phone will also have to be in airplane mode to prevent the Rode VideoMic Me from recording unwanted clicking noise caused by background processes performed by your phone. So you wouldn’t want to use this for livestreaming.</p><h3 id="6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set"><a href="#6-Aukey-Optic-3-in-1-Smartphone-Lens-Set" class="headerlink" title="6. Aukey Optic 3-in-1 Smartphone Lens Set"></a>6. Aukey Optic 3-in-1 Smartphone Lens Set</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-smartphone-lens-set.jpg"                      alt="Aukey Optic 3-in-1 Smartphone Lens Set"                ></p><p>Aukey makes a 3-in-1 lens set that you can clamp onto your smartphone so that you can vlog at different focal lengths. The 3-in-1 set comes with a wide-angle lens, a fisheye lens, and a macro lens. The clamp it comes with is long enough for these lenses to reach any camera on a smartphone, not just those of iPhones which are positioned close to the phone’s outer edge. To get the most out of these lenses, you’ll have to use them without your phone’s protective case on. Although you are free to use this lens set on either your phone’s rear-facing camera or front-facing camera, the metal housing of these lenses is likely to show up in your footage when you use them with your front-facing camera. So, instead of having your recorded image stretch to the ends of a 16:9 ratio rectangular frame, your recorded image will look as if it is contained inside a circle. This lens set sells for around $30 USD.</p><h3 id="7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone"><a href="#7-iOgrapher-Go-for-Android-and-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone"></a>7. iOgrapher Go for Android and iPhone</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-iographer-go.jpg"                      alt="iOgrapher Go"                ></p><p>There’s many more accessories that you can take advantage of if you don’t limit yourself to just smartphone camera accessories. Sound and lighting equipment made for stand-alone cameras perform much better too. Many of these accessories are meant to connect to the camera “shoe” (a bracket on top of the camera that accessories can be attached to). Smartphones don’t come with these kinds of shoes. So, to take advantage of these higher quality accessories, you’ll need some kind of camera rig for your smartphone that also comes with shoes. The iOgrapher Go offers this at around $60 USD. This accessory comes with three shoes.</p><h3 id="8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System"><a href="#8-Manfrotto-TwistGrip-System" class="headerlink" title="8. Manfrotto TwistGrip System"></a>8. Manfrotto TwistGrip System</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-twist-grip-system.jpg"                      alt="Manfrotto TwistGrip System"                ></p><p>Manfrotto’s TwistGrip System does a similar job to the above iOgrapher Go. This system also comes with three shoes. An advantage the TwistGrip System has over the iOgrapher Go is that it is much more portable. Its three connected parts can be detached to take up less space in your bag. This system sells for around $50 USD.</p><h3 id="9-Zhiyun-Smooth-Q-3-Axis-Handheld-Gimbal-Stabilizer-for-Smartphones"><a href="#9-Zhiyun-Smooth-Q-3-Axis-Handheld-Gimbal-Stabilizer-for-Smartphones" class="headerlink" title="9. Zhiyun Smooth-Q 3-Axis Handheld Gimbal Stabilizer for Smartphones"></a>9. Zhiyun Smooth-Q 3-Axis Handheld Gimbal Stabilizer for Smartphones</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-accessories-gimbal-stabilizer.jpg"                      alt="Zhiyun Smooth-Q"                ></p><p>My favorite smartphone camera accessory that I own is the Zhiyun Smooth-Q gimbal stabilizer. This gimbal is very effective in helping you record smooth video. Using the app that it comes with, you can even preset this gimbal to smoothly pan and rotate from a starting position to an ending position, giving you the opportunity to film beautiful time lapses. You can get this device at around $100 USD.</p><h3 id="Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Polish-Your-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software in YouTube video editing, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides lots of templates and effects with an intuitive interface, which saves much time.

Pricing ranges from $550 to $850, depending on when you buy your ticket.</p><p> *The Meet and Greet Lottery is a chance for anyone attending with a Community or Industry pass to meet their favorite creator.

As a YouTuber, you become a business, and it helps to know the YouTube views to money earned.</p><p>If you are trying to earn a living on YouTube, one of the most excellent marks of a successful creator is often earning 1 million views on the platform (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html" >click here for tips on how to do that <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). It usually serves as a benchmark for a time at which a channel is relatively sustainable. However, rather than meaning a YouTuber has made it big financially, reaching 1 million views is more likely to say they can expect to <em>start</em> making real money.</p><p>When you hit 1 million views on any video on YouTube, you’ll have a nice paycheck. You’ll likely have to hit 1 million views on at least a few other videos before you could consider quitting your full-time job and doing YouTube as your primary source of income. This article will explore what 1 million views mean for your YouTube channel. We will look more into how revenue is calculated on YouTube and what you can expect to earn-out of a video with 1 million views.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">$2000 for 1 million views</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How is the revenue calculated?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">CPMs and CPCs</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How monetization is changing</a></p><h2 id="2000-for-1-Million-Views"><a href="#2000-for-1-Million-Views" class="headerlink" title="$2000 for 1 Million Views"></a>$2000 for 1 Million Views</h2><p>In <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3018123/a-million-youtube-views-wont-pay-your-rent-but-tubestart-could" >a case study performed by Standupbits <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Josef Holm, a YouTube channel is created with over 3500 comedy clips that a comedian and stand up actor had put together over the years. The YouTube clips took extensive time to upload, and the library was prevalent. The YouTube ad revenue only equated to around $2000.</p><p>Although StandUpBits had uploaded thousands of clips and received over 1 million views on their channel, their library was only able to earn around $2000 from the ad revenue sharing. It’s estimated the group had spent approximately $25,000 to finish off the clips, edit them, and upload them, which means they invested far more in the channel than they earned.</p><p>If you are thinking about a career on YouTube, reaching 1 million views might seem like an excellent target for making a successful page, and it is, but reaching 1 million views doesn’t magically guarantee financial success.</p><h2 id="How-Revenue-is-Calculated"><a href="#How-Revenue-is-Calculated" class="headerlink" title="How Revenue is Calculated"></a>How Revenue is Calculated</h2><p>In order to understand how revenue is calculated over the YouTube marketplace, a YouTube user needs to first understand what the partnership program entails. Basically, a YouTube partner has the ability to monetize their videos and serve ads on their content.</p><p>In order to join this program you need to be able to commit to uploading ad-friendly (nothing controversial) content that is completely original and high quality and which also adheres to all of the community guidelines and YouTube’s Terms of Service (YouTube actually just introduced a couple of stricter rules - click here for <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization-2018---the-new-rules-everyone-hates-331.html" >YouTube Monetization 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p>As of February 2018, to qualify for ad revenue, the YouTube channel must have:</p><p>1. You will need to have 1,000 subscribers.</p><p>2. You will need to have accumulated 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months.</p><p>The AdSense revenue that you earn through YouTube will vary depending on a large number of factors related to the specific ads running and what type of content you produce.</p><h2 id="Understanding-CPM-and-CPCs"><a href="#Understanding-CPM-and-CPCs" class="headerlink" title="Understanding CPM and CPCs"></a>Understanding CPM and CPCs</h2><h3 id="What-is-CPM"><a href="#What-is-CPM" class="headerlink" title="What is CPM?"></a>What is CPM?</h3><p>CPM stands as the ‘cost per mille’ or ‘cost per thousand.’</p><p>Your CPM is the amount you earn for 1000 ad impressions (1000 viewers clicking on an ad or watching a skippable ad). Your CPM is usually related to the demographics of your users, the content you regularly post, the length of time on the videos that you post, and the gender of your viewers.

It can take some extra time to add in all of this information for each video, but it is well worth it if you are trying to get paid from YouTube.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-subscriber-boost%21-the-4-simplest-tricks-to-grow-your-317.html" >Click here for 4 ways to start growing your channel faster. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, how much does YouTube pay for 1 million views?

YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.</p><p>However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the <strong>best YouTube Live screen recorders</strong> you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos&#x2F;audio materials from your own channel.</p><h2 id="Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders"><a href="#Top-10-YouTube-Live-Screen-Recorders" class="headerlink" title="Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders"></a>Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders</h2><p>The maximum resolution in which you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record computer screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.</p><p>We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let’s take a look at what they have to offer.</p><h3 id="1-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. OBS Studio"></a>1. OBS Studio</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, Linux, macOS</p><p>The vast majority of live streams you can find on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.</p><p>OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.</p><p>OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >open-source software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.</p><p>Check the detailed guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record with OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="2-XSplit"><a href="#2-XSplit" class="headerlink" title="2.

The software allows you to capture screens in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and at 60 fps, but it also offers a variety of resolution and frame rate options so that you can choose the one that best fits your needs. Furthermore, you can record the computer audio, which enables you to capture the live stream’s audio in excellent quality. Besides YouTube Live, XSplit can be used with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Skype, Google Hangouts, and numerous other live streaming and video calling apps.</p><h3 id="3-Filmora"><a href="#3-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3.

Once you are done recording the live stream you shared on YouTube, you can edit the footage you created before uploading it to your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="4-Wondershare-DemoCreator"><a href="#4-Wondershare-DemoCreator" class="headerlink" title="4.

CloudApp</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, $10 per month for an individual user</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome</p><p>Starting a new screen capturing session with the CloudApp requires you to just specify the portion of the screen you want to capture and hit the record button. Moreover, you can choose if you want to record with or without a webcam and you have the option to enable or disable the audio recording option.</p><p>However, you can only create 90-second screen recordings with the free version of the CloudApp and you cannot set resolution or frame rate of the recording. That’s why you need to upgrade to the Pro version if you want to use it to record live streams on YouTube. The Pro subscription model also grants you access to basic video editing tools and a variety of file sharing options. In addition, CloudApp lets you create and annotate still images and GIFs, which makes it a great option for digital marketers.</p><h3 id="6-Techsmith-Camtasia"><a href="#6-Techsmith-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="6.

You can only record the entire screen with VLC, since customizing the recording area isn’t an option, and all your files will be captured in the RAW format which means that you may have to resize them before you upload them to YouTube.</p><h3 id="10-Screencast-o-matic"><a href="#10-Screencast-o-matic" class="headerlink" title="10.

One of these leaps is the use of the <strong>chroma key background</strong>, which most people know by the more colloquial term—green screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/a-quick-guide-to-chroma-key-background-1.jpg"                      alt="clipper in front of green screen"                ></p><p>Chroma key, also known as green screen or blue screen, is a cool hack for seamless visual storytelling, allowing content creators to replace backgrounds with any image or video they want. This technique is widely embraced in film, television, and online content, and has opened the door to limitless creative possibilities. Aside from its ability to maximize creativity, it is also cheap to employ and convenient to set up, which has made it a staple for everyone who works with visuals.</p><p>In this simple guide, we’ll delve into the fundamentals of the <strong>chroma key effect</strong>, how it is used for video making, and how to leverage that as you perfect your visual content.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="How-Does-Chroma-Key-Work"><a href="#How-Does-Chroma-Key-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does Chroma Key Work?"></a><strong>How Does Chroma Key Work?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/a-quick-guide-to-chroma-key-background-2.jpg"                      alt="green screen shooting"                ></p><p>Chroma Keying is done by singling out a specific color (usually green or blue) from the foreground, removing it, and replacing it with a different background (for example, a sunset). This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><h2 id="Why-Green"><a href="#Why-Green" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production. To prevent shadow interference, the green screen should be smooth, tense, and without wrinkles or shadows.</p><p>High-quality cameras are essential every time, especially for chroma keying. Images with better definition are easier to key, so camera quality significantly affects the outcome. Even if your camera isn’t the best, merely shooting well can ensure a clean color-keying process during editing, resulting in professional-looking visuals.</p><h2 id="Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key"><a href="#Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key" class="headerlink" title="Recording Tips for Chroma Key"></a>Recording Tips for Chroma Key</h2><ul><li>Proper Lighting</li></ul><p>Maintaining uniform and well-defined lighting during recording is essential for a successful chroma-keying process. This consistency ensures a seamless keying process during post-production.</p><ul><li>Keep Distance from the Green Screen</li></ul><p>The optimal distance between the subject and the green screen minimizes color spill and allows for natural movements. Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues. Subjects also have to be positioned in such a way that there is minimal light interference and reflection. These contribute to a flawless chroma key outcome.</p><h2 id="3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies"><a href="#3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies"></a>3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies</h2><ul><li>Color Spill</li></ul><p>Sometimes, reflected light from your green background can be cast on your subject and may remain so when the background light is keyed out. This phenomenon is known as a color spill. It is usually because of uneven lighting or shooting around reflecting surfaces. Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly. Due to the translucency of hair, it is common for some unintended light to seep through. This allows some background visibility, which you do not want with a chroma key. This is especially notable with lighter hair colors like blond hair.</p><p>There are ways to account for this. Many video-editing software have features such as spill suppression and screen matte adjustments that can enhance the final footage. Specialized plugins also go a long way in ensuring minimizing spill. Addressing spill correction tackles unwanted green artifacts and ensures a clean keying process.</p><ul><li>Poor Lighting</li></ul><p>Suboptimal green screen lighting can lead to inconsistencies in keying and editing, undermining your product. One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste. Softening and refining edges make a smoother transition between the foreground object and the new background. Light adjustments to edge thickness and screen matte settings can also help enhance overall visual quality and add finesse to your work.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Green screen photography produces excellent results, and its ease of use makes it indispensable for videographers of all levels.

Aside from its ability to maximize creativity, it is also cheap to employ and convenient to set up, which has made it a staple for everyone who works with visuals.</p><p>In this simple guide, we’ll delve into the fundamentals of the <strong>chroma key effect</strong>, how it is used for video making, and how to leverage that as you perfect your visual content.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="How-Does-Chroma-Key-Work-1"><a href="#How-Does-Chroma-Key-Work-1" class="headerlink" title="How Does Chroma Key Work?"></a><strong>How Does Chroma Key Work?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/a-quick-guide-to-chroma-key-background-2.jpg"                      alt="green screen shooting"                ></p><p>Chroma Keying is done by singling out a specific color (usually green or blue) from the foreground, removing it, and replacing it with a different background (for example, a sunset). This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><h2 id="Why-Green-1"><a href="#Why-Green-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio-1"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out. This choice determines your effective color separation and ensures a smooth keying process during editing. Choosing a chroma-key background color that contrasts distinctly with the subject’s colors is essential for effective color separation. This prevents unintentional transparency, color spill, and ensures a polished final result.</p><p>Lighting Considerations</p><p>Lighting is an important part of the chroma-keying process. Bold, uniform, and consistent lighting on both the subject and the background makes it easy to delineate one from the other fully. This minimizes shadows and variations in color, creating a smooth and seamless keying process. Multiple diffuse lights from different angles are often used to illuminate the green screen evenly.</p><p>Positioning&#x2F;Camera</p><p>Proper subject and camera placement are necessary to ensure an even color-keying process during post-production. To prevent shadow interference, the green screen should be smooth, tense, and without wrinkles or shadows.</p><p>High-quality cameras are essential every time, especially for chroma keying. Images with better definition are easier to key, so camera quality significantly affects the outcome. Even if your camera isn’t the best, merely shooting well can ensure a clean color-keying process during editing, resulting in professional-looking visuals.</p><h2 id="Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key-1"><a href="#Recording-Tips-for-Chroma-Key-1" class="headerlink" title="Recording Tips for Chroma Key"></a>Recording Tips for Chroma Key</h2><ul><li>Proper Lighting</li></ul><p>Maintaining uniform and well-defined lighting during recording is essential for a successful chroma-keying process. This consistency ensures a seamless keying process during post-production.</p><ul><li>Keep Distance from the Green Screen</li></ul><p>The optimal distance between the subject and the green screen minimizes color spill and allows for natural movements. Proper distance between subject and background allows for easier isolation of the background and much smoother post-editing. A recommended starting point for the issue is around 6 to 10 feet from the background.</p><ul><li>Subjects and Clothing</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, the choice of costume for Selecting appropriate clothing that doesn’t match the chroma key color prevents transparency issues. Subjects also have to be positioned in such a way that there is minimal light interference and reflection. These contribute to a flawless chroma key outcome.</p><h2 id="3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies-1"><a href="#3-Basic-Troubleshooting-Strategies-1" class="headerlink" title="3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies"></a>3 Basic Troubleshooting Strategies</h2><ul><li>Color Spill</li></ul><p>Sometimes, reflected light from your green background can be cast on your subject and may remain so when the background light is keyed out. This phenomenon is known as a color spill. It is usually because of uneven lighting or shooting around reflecting surfaces. Avoiding spill can differentiate between good and lousy chroma key aftereffects.</p><p>Human hair is one area where color spill can show up unsuspectingly. Due to the translucency of hair, it is common for some unintended light to seep through. This allows some background visibility, which you do not want with a chroma key. This is especially notable with lighter hair colors like blond hair.</p><p>There are ways to account for this. Many video-editing software have features such as spill suppression and screen matte adjustments that can enhance the final footage. Specialized plugins also go a long way in ensuring minimizing spill. Addressing spill correction tackles unwanted green artifacts and ensures a clean keying process.</p><ul><li>Poor Lighting</li></ul><p>Suboptimal green screen lighting can lead to inconsistencies in keying and editing, undermining your product. One way to avoid this is to light the screen and subject separately. Another tip, although expensive, is using multiple diffuse light sources and trying to maintain even lighting across every square foot of your scene. Super bright or dark spots can ruin your output, so it’s worth the extra effort if you don’t want to deal with problematic post-production.</p><ul><li>Poorly Refined Edges</li></ul><p>Chroma keying should leave your videos with crisp, defined, natural-looking edges. But post-production editing can make all the difference if it doesn’t come out to your taste. Softening and refining edges make a smoother transition between the foreground object and the new background. Light adjustments to edge thickness and screen matte settings can also help enhance overall visual quality and add finesse to your work.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Green screen photography produces excellent results, and its ease of use makes it indispensable for videographers of all levels.

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting. Consequently, new YouTubers lose their audience’s attention too early on.</p><p>To read more on how some of the most successful YouTubers effectively do their intros, check out my blogpost on “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Edit YouTube Videos Like a YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><h3 id="6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers"><a href="#6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers"></a>6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers</h3><p>An important thing to do as a new YouTuber is engaging with your subscribers. Some new YouTubers, though, are so focused and busy with the production side of things that they forget to do the community side of things, including responding to comments. By not responding to comments as a new YouTuber, you hurt your potential to get more comments consistently from your subscribers. If your video’s comments section is very active, YouTube ranks your video higher in the videos it recommends to viewers.</p><p>Connecting with your audience shouldn’t just be limited to YouTube either. Use your other social media channels to connect with your audience as well.</p><h3 id="7-Not-promoting-with-social-media"><a href="#7-Not-promoting-with-social-media" class="headerlink" title="7. Not promoting with social media"></a>7. Not promoting with social media</h3><p>YouTube isn’t the only social media platform that people are spending their time on. People are spending their time on all kinds of different social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The more content in all of these platforms that you create to promote your video, the more potential your video has to be seen by their users.</p><p>New YouTubers sometimes forget to promote their videos and channel using other social media platforms. Consequently, they miss out on the opportunity to get views from multiple sources of social media.</p><h3 id="8-Spamming-comments"><a href="#8-Spamming-comments" class="headerlink" title="8. Spamming comments"></a>8. Spamming comments</h3><p>Commenting on other YouTube videos is another way to get your channel discovered from people reading over comments. If your profile picture and comment appears interesting enough, out of curiosity, people just might click your username to have a look at your channel.</p><p>But rather than leaving interesting comments that are related to the video, rather than adding to the conversation, some new YouTubers desperate to get more subscribers make the mistake of spamming videos with “check out my YouTube channel!” comments.</p><p>Spam comments annoy YouTubers. It would be much more beneficial to your channel to build good relationships with other YouTubers to possibly collaborate on a video together in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-secrets-to-crafting-enthralling-edu-videos-for-the-digital-age/"><u>[Updated] Secrets to Crafting Enthralling Edu-Videos for the Digital Age</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-12-exceptional-game-starting-tutorials-from-youtube-pros-freepremium/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  12 Exceptional Game-Starting Tutorials From YouTube Pros (Free/Premium)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ing-revenue-the-content-creators-playbook/"><u>Boosting Revenue  The Content Creator's Playbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-unlocking-simplicity-your-guide-to-direct-signup-buttons/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unlocking Simplicity  Your Guide to Direct Signup Buttons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-5-top-link-minimizers-transforming-youtube-watchability/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  5-Top Link Minimizers Transforming YouTube Watchability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/mline-your-content-advanced-tricks-with-youtube-studio-editor/"><u>Streamline Your Content  Advanced Tricks with YouTube Studio Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-youtube-teaser-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Mastering the Art of YouTube Teaser Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ring-the-art-and-size-game-your-guide-to-top-tier-yt-banners-for-2024/"><u>Mastering the Art & Size Game  Your Guide to Top-Tier YT Banners for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/fficient-time-markers-in-youtube-videos-desktopmobile-edition-for-2024/"><u>[New] Efficient Time Markers in YouTube Videos (Desktop/Mobile Edition) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-unlock-engagement-the-optimal-aspect-ratios-for-linkedin-videos/"><u>New Unlock Engagement The Optimal Aspect Ratios for LinkedIn Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-unlock-apple-iphone-14-pro-without-passcode-or-face-id-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro without Passcode or Face ID | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/rapid-accessibility-of-instagram-videos-and-stories-for-2024/"><u>Rapid Accessibility of Instagram Videos and Stories for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-content-compromise-rapid-deletion-dilemma/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Content Compromise  Rapid Deletion Dilemma</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlocking-the-potential-of-capturing-digital-entertainment/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unlocking the Potential of Capturing Digital Entertainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-whatsapp-from-iphone-15-to-other-iphone-11-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer WhatsApp From iPhone 15 to other iPhone 11 devices?

Above all, it works independently, a feature that most users adore as compared to the encasing of Shorts within YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-ultimate-wirecast-playbook-for-engaging-youtube-streamers/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate WireCast Playbook for Engaging YouTube Streamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/h-transition-of-online-videos-to-tv-screens/"><u>Smooth Transition of Online Videos to TV Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-key-information-every-asmr-aficionado-should-know/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Key Information Every ASMR Aficionado Should Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ringing-text-to-life-a-guide-to-dynamic-animation-methods-for-2024/"><u>[New] Bringing Text to Life  A Guide to Dynamic Animation Methods for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-the-path-to-popularity-unveiling-tubebuddy-secrets/"><u>2024 Approved  The Path to Popularity  Unveiling TubeBuddy Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/studio-to-screen-uploading-melodies-online-for-2024/"><u>From Studio to Screen  Uploading Melodies Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-beyond-simplicity-exploring-the-intricacies-of-youtubes-view-count-algorithm/"><u>[Updated] Beyond Simplicity  Exploring the Intricacies of YouTube’s View Count Algorithm</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/reate-professional-movies-on-youtube-quickly-for-2024/"><u>[New] Create Professional Movies on YouTube Quickly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-channel-wrap-up-strategies-free-youtube-end-screens-tutorial/"><u>In 2024, Channel Wrap-Up Strategies - Free YouTube End Screens Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-cant-take-screenshot-due-to-security-policy-on-tecno-phantom-v-fold-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix Cant Take Screenshot Due to Security Policy on Tecno Phantom V Fold | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/top-8-iphone-se-smsmessagetext-recovery-software-stellar-by-stellar-data-recovery-ios-iphone-data-recovery/"><u>Top 8 iPhone SE SMS/Message/Text Recovery Software | Stellar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-audio-capture-utilities-for-desktop-computers/"><u>Updated Top 10 Audio Capture Utilities for Desktop Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-master-the-art-of-downloading-gifs-from-facebook-on-multiple-devices-effortlessly/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Master the Art of Downloading GIFs From Facebook on Multiple Devices Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/reasons-for-oppo-a56s-5g-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Oppo A56s 5G Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-techniques-for-striking-podcast-cover-designs-your-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Essential Techniques for Striking Podcast Cover Designs Your Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-15-best-stop-motion-animation-kits-to-fuel-creativity/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved 15 Best Stop Motion Animation Kits to Fuel Creativity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Forgot Pattern Lock?

In theory, these recommendations are based on your viewing habits and you’re only directed to videos you’re interested in.</p><p>Except we all know that’s not always what happens.</p><p>YouTube’s recommendations are based on more than just what you’ve watched and searched for, and sometimes even the data on that can get skewed over time. Not all your searches reflect your real tastes, and as your search history builds up the algorithm can start having trouble with all that data.</p><p>Here’s what you can do about it:</p><ol><li><a href="#manage"><strong>Manage Your Watch History</strong></a></li><li><a href="#notinterested"><strong>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</strong></a></li><li><a href="#butwhy"><strong>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Manage-Your-Watch-History"><a href="#Manage-Your-Watch-History" class="headerlink" title="Manage Your Watch History"></a>Manage Your Watch History</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-watch-history.jpg"                      alt="Manage Watch History"                ></p><p>Scroll to the bottom of any page on YouTube and you will see a button marked <strong>History</strong> with an hourglass icon. To access this feature using a mobile device, go to the <strong>Account</strong> tab and tap <strong>History</strong>.</p><p>You will be able to completely clear your watch history, remove specific videos from it, or pause your history while you look at videos you don’t want a record of you visiting. By taking control of your history, you can make sure nothing you looked up on a random whim is reflected in your recommendations.</p><p>If you are being recommended more things you aren’t interested in than things you are, you might want to clear your history completely and start fresh. Maybe your tastes have changed since YouTube started keeping track of them.</p><h2 id="Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested"><a href="#Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested" class="headerlink" title="Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested"></a>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tell-youtube-not-interested.jpg"                      alt="Tell YouTube Not Interested"                ></p><p>Based on your watch history, YouTube knows what you like. However, they have no way of automatically collecting data on what kinds of videos you’d rather not see.</p><p>What they do have is a system for you to flag recommendations you don’t like.</p><p>Hover over the thumbnail of a video you don’t want to be recommended to you and a small icon that looks like three stacked dots will appear next to the title. Click on that, and then click <strong>Not Interested</strong>.</p><p>When you tell YouTube you aren’t interested in certain videos they use that data to adjust what they recommend for you.</p><h2 id="But-Why-Does-It-Recommend-Stuff-I-Don’t-Like"><a href="#But-Why-Does-It-Recommend-Stuff-I-Don’t-Like" class="headerlink" title="But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?"></a>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</h2><p>Your search&#x2F;watch history is not the only thing that determines what YouTube recommends for you. Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch <strong>time</strong>.</p><p>Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn’t closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you’ll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that’ll keep you around.</p><p>  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used"><a

It is distracting and makes it difficult to engage with the content of a video. If there is noticeable background noise in a video, even a small noise like the faint hum of a computer fan, then it will increase the chances of viewers clicking away. The good news is that these kinds of noises are fairly easy to get rid of.</p><p>In order to remove background noise from your video clip, you will first need to create an MP3 of your audio.

After you click <strong>Convert&#x2F;Save</strong> you will be able to choose your format, in this case, MP3, under <strong>Save as type</strong>.</p><h4 id="2-Removing-Background-Noise-in-Audacity"><a href="#2-Removing-Background-Noise-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="2.  Removing Background Noise in Audacity"></a>2.  Removing Background Noise in Audacity</h4><p>You can download Audacity for free at Audacityteam.org.</p><p>Once you have Audacity use it to open your MP3. Then, find a section of your audio that is silent aside from your background noise and highlight it by clicking and dragging. The idea is to point out to the program exactly what sound is a problem for you so it knows what to remove. If you have trouble finding a significant stretch of background noise that does not also include dialogue remember to record a pause before or after the content of your video next time you film.</p><p>With your section of background noise highlighted, go to <strong>Effect</strong> and then <strong>Noise Reduction</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Get Noise Profile</strong>. After that, you will select your entire audio timeline before going back to <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> under <strong>Effect</strong>. This time click on <strong>OK</strong> (the default settings are the best in most situations so you do not need to worry about changing them).</p><p>Audacity will remove everything that sounds like the sound profile, eliminating your background noise. Sometimes this method will also dull your dialogue, which can be fixed by selecting your entire track and then going to <strong>Effect</strong> and <strong>Amplify</strong>. Increasing amplification will fix any muffling of your audio.</p><h4 id="3-Syncing-in-Filmora"><a href="#3-Syncing-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Syncing in Filmora"></a>3. Syncing in Filmora</h4><p>Export your corrected MP3 from Audacity and import it into Filmora. Then, drag it into your music track. Syncing your audio should not be difficult, but you can always use your original audio to help you line it up properly if you need to. Just look for a significant spike in your audio waves in both your MP3 and the original audio and make sure they are right on top of each other.</p><p>Then, since you no longer need your original audio, you can delete it. Right-click on your clip and select <strong>Audio Detach</strong>. Once your audio is on its own track just select it and click delete.</p><h3 id="Covering-Background-Noise"><a href="#Covering-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Covering Background Noise"></a>Covering Background Noise</h3><p>Sometimes background noise is so minor that you do not want to bother going through the process of removing it. In these situations, it may be easier to cover up your background noise than to remove it. This is as simple as dragging a song into the music track of your timeline and adjusting its volume so it is not loud enough to draw attention away from your dialogue. Chances are you want to add background music anyways and this is not even an extra step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Here are ten <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to share your personal story.</p><ul><li><a href="#one">Channel Trailer</a></li><li><a href="#two">My YouTube Story</a></li><li><a href="#three">Draw My Life</a></li><li><a href="#four">Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#five">Never Have I Ever Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#six">Get Ready With me Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="#seven">My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</a></li><li><a href="#eight">Narrated Autobiopic</a></li><li><a href="#nine">25 Facts About Me</a></li><li><a href="#ten">YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar</a></li></ul><h3 id="1-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#1-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="1.  Channel Trailer"></a>1.  Channel Trailer</h3><p>Before posting any videos on your channel, it can be a great idea to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a “Channel Trailer” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> summarizing who you are and what your channel is all about.</p><p>YouTuber Shameless Maya does an excellent job of this. She created a visually appealing and engaging 1-2 minute channel trailer that explains exactly what her channel is all about. Feel free to be as creative as you want to be.</p><h3 id="2-My-YouTube-Story"><a href="#2-My-YouTube-Story" class="headerlink" title="2.  My YouTube Story"></a>2.  My YouTube Story</h3><p>On Monday, May 17th, 2010, YouTube celebrated its fifth anniversary. In celebration of hitting their five-year mark, YouTube launched a “My YouTube Story” campaign, which featured fifteen YouTubers sharing how YouTube has changed their lives. Each of these videos would end with “What’s your YouTube story? Tell us by uploading a video.” Ever since that campaign, many YouTubers have shared their YouTube story, including me! After I had been on YouTube for two years, I felt it was time for me to share my own YouTube story with the world. Sharing your story is not only an opportunity for your viewers to get to know you but a way to inspire other creators to start their channels as well. We all have our reasons for why we started, so why not share them?</p><h3 id="3-Draw-My-Life"><a href="#3-Draw-My-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Draw My Life"></a>3.  Draw My Life</h3><p>“Draw My Life” is a popular video where YouTubers share their life stories through a unique series of drawings. Often YouTubers use a white dry erase board and markers so they can erase and redraw the series of their life events. Mr. Kate provides a great example of this as she is a talented artist and DIY’er. The great thing about this is you don’t have to be an artist or a great drawer. It’s a fun way to be creative and tell your story.</p><h3 id="4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A"><a href="#4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A"></a>4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</h3><p>Who isn’t on Snapchat, Instagram, or both these days? Over the past year, I’ve seen YouTubers get creative by asking their viewers to send snaps asking questions they will answer on a Q &amp; A video on their channel. This video idea is great because it involves live viewer participation and a chance for viewers to be seen or noticed on their favorite Youtuber’s channels. Beauty guru stars Manny MUA and Jeffrey Star did a great example of this as a collaboration.</p><h3 id="5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A"><a href="#5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A"></a>5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A</h3><p>Who hasn’t played the “Never Have I Ever” game?! Playing this game as a Q &amp; A is a great way for viewers to get to know you better with some juicy and shocking details about yourself they otherwise wouldn’t know. It’s also a great way to play and collaborate with another YouTuber. Often, the questions will be split and you have to watch both YouTubers’ videos to find out all the details. Highly popular beauty YouTuber Desi Perkins does a great example of this while playing the game with her sister in law.</p><h3 id="6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A"><a href="#6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A"></a>6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A</h3><p>Get ready with me Q &amp; As are some of my favorite videos to watch because it’s nice to see YouTubers strip-down bare-faced to do their makeup and answer popular questions. It often feels like two old friends sitting down to chat. Jenn, I’m doing a great example of this when she took to twitter asking viewers to ask her questions she would answer on her channel. Not only did she answer the questions but she gave a detailed makeup tutorial and explanation of the products she used as a 2 for 1. Even if your channel has nothing to do with makeup or fashion, some viewers can still be intrigued to learn more about your fashion and makeup style.</p><h3 id="7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story"><a href="#7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story" class="headerlink" title="7.  My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story"></a>7.  My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</h3><p>Behind all their smiles and outrageous on-camera personas, there are a lot of YouTubers who are dealing with depression and anxiety. Beauty and fashion YouTuber Alyssa Forever not only shared her story on how she dealt with her depression but gave tips and ways to be happier. If you are facing depression, anxiety, or some other mental illness, it can give others hope if you share your story.</p><h3 id="8-Narrated-Autobiopic"><a href="#8-Narrated-Autobiopic" class="headerlink" title="8.  Narrated Autobiopic"></a>8.  Narrated Autobiopic</h3><p>Narrated Autobiopic videos are a great way to share your story or advice in a cinematic way. You can be as creative as you want to be. YouTuber Evelyn From the Internets posted a narrated autobiopic called “For People Who Feel Behind In Life” that comically introduces her story.</p><h3 id="9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag"><a href="#9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag" class="headerlink" title="9.  25 Facts About Me Tag"></a>9.  25 Facts About Me Tag</h3><p>This is probably one of the easiest ways to share things about yourself when starting as a YouTuber or even if you’re a veteran. Viewers are always looking to learn more interesting things about you so you are more relatable. I’ve been a fan of Vasseur Beauty for a few years now and was surprised by many of the things she shared about herself.</p><h3 id="10-YouTube-Live-Webinar"><a href="#10-YouTube-Live-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="10.  YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar"></a>10.  YouTube Live&#x2F;Webinar</h3><p>YouTube live videos are probably the best ways to interact and share your story with viewers. Viewers can ask questions on the spot. YouTuber Roberto Blake shares great live videos on how to improve your videos and things he’s learned through personal experience.</p><h2 id="Custom-Your-Video-with-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a href="#Custom-Your-Video-with-Excellent-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Custom Your Video with Excellent Video Editor"></a>Custom Your Video with Excellent Video Editor</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-elevating-video-previews-a-compreayer-approach-for-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Elevating Video Previews  A Compreayer Approach for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-boosting-audience-size-a-comprehensive-guide-to-youtube-shorts-success/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Audience Size  A Comprehensive Guide to YouTube Shorts Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-imagecraft-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, ImageCraft Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/mplify-youtube-performance-rapid-video-rendering-guide/"><u>[New] Amplify YouTube Performance -

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Hasty-Guide-From-Raw-Images-to-High-Quality-YouTube-Thumbnail-Art"><a href="#Hasty-Guide-From-Raw-Images-to-High-Quality-YouTube-Thumbnail-Art" class="headerlink" title="Hasty Guide: From Raw Images to High-Quality YouTube Thumbnail Art"></a>Hasty Guide: From Raw Images to High-Quality YouTube Thumbnail Art</h2><p>There is a saying that first impressions last, and this is proven true, especially when it comes to YouTube video viewership. For sure, you have experienced watching a video out of curiosity because of its thumbnail. That is why content creators take time to resize YouTube thumbnails or use a YouTube thumbnail size converter to customize the preview images that represent their videos.</p><p>This technique not only attract viewers to watch your video, but it also gives a glimpse of your content. In this article, we will provide you with a quick tutorial on how to resize a YouTube thumbnail and suggest handy tools you can use to create the perfect YouTube video thumbnail!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resize-youtube-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="youtube thumbnail resize"                ></p><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Thumbnail-Size" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Thumbnail Size"></a>Best YouTube Thumbnail Size</h2><p>According to YouTube’s help center, there are some things to remember when creating a thumbnail for your YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>First, make sure that the thumbnail size is 1280 pixels by 720 pixels and 640 pixels wide. It is the best YouTube thumbnail size.</li><li>When it comes to the thumbnail dimension, make sure to use an aspect ratio of 16:9.</li><li>Also, your YouTube thumbnail image should not exceed 2MB and is in either JPG, GIF or PNG format.</li></ul><h2 id="How-To-Resize-Your-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#How-To-Resize-Your-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="How To Resize Your YouTube Thumbnail"></a>How To Resize Your YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>The primary reason for changing the YouTube thumbnail size is to gain more audience. If you are a content creator, your main goal is to introduce your content to a wider range of viewers, right? So you have to pay attention to even the smallest detail, such as YouTube thumbnails to increase viewership and top YouTube SEO.</p><p>In fact, YouTube recommends this technique to get more viewers. Also, resizing your YouTube thumbnail will prevent you from getting the “file larger than 2MB error” which can cause your thumbnail to be discarded.</p><p>So, how can you use this technique? Check our tutorial below as we walk you through various recommended methods for resizing a YouTube thumbnail:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Resize-YouTube-Thumbnail-With-Windows-Default-App"><a href="#Method-1-Resize-YouTube-Thumbnail-With-Windows-Default-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App"></a>Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App</h3><p>The easiest way to resize YouTube thumbnails is through the Windows default app. Within just a few modifications, you can resize your thumbnail to fit as a preview image for your YouTube video.</p><p>Please take note that your image should be at least 2 megabytes or less to achieve the perfect YouTube thumbnail fit.

They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks.

Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.</p><p>To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Install and <strong>launch</strong> GIMP on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-install.JPG"                      alt="gimp install"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Open</strong>,” then search for the file you want to resize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-open-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp open thumbnail"                ></p><p>Step3 Click on “<strong>Image</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Scale Image</strong>“ and make sure that the resolution is 1920 by 1080.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-edit-resolution.JPG"                      alt="gimp edit resolution"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Export As</strong>“ and <strong>toggle</strong> the “<strong>Select File Type (By Extension)</strong>“ option. <strong>Choose</strong> JPG&#x2F;JPEG format because it can compress the thumbnail enough to stay within the limit of 2 megabytes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-format.JPG"                      alt="gimp export format"                ></p><p>Step5 You can change the quality of the image and <strong>click</strong> the “<strong>Export</strong>“ button to save the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp export thumbnail"                ></p><h2 id="Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods-1"><a href="#Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods-1" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods"></a>Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods</h2><p>Now that we’ve explored the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails, it’s time to compare the pros and cons of each method.

However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.</p><p>Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP. Each method has advantages and disadvantages; the best one depends on your specific needs and preferences.
