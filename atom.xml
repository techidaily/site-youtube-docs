But even though other forms of creative expression, like art and writing, may reflect something about the personhood of their creator, very few forms of creative expression seem to shine as much of a spotlight on who you are as a person as vlogging.</p><p>When it comes to vlogging, it is your face, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >voice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thoughts, and feelings that your audience sees and hears close-up. That is why vlogging can seem even more terrifying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-fear.jpg"                      alt="Vlogging Fears"                ></p><p>Below is a list of 10 of the most common fears people have with vlogging and ways to overcome them.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="1-Fear-of-Looking-Stupid-Talking-To-Your-Camera"><a href="#1-Fear-of-Looking-Stupid-Talking-To-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1. Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera"></a>1. Fear of Looking Stupid Talking To Your Camera</h3><p>It can be nerve-racking to talk to your camera in public, especially if your vlog set-up attracts a lot of attention (Casey Neistat’s famous rig consisting of a DSLR camera with a GorillaPod tripod and a Rode shotgun mic attached to it definitely attracts more attention than just your everyday smartphone). Despite a lot of vloggers suggesting that people don’t care as much as you think they care, it still is an activity that stands out, gets noticed, and creates curiosity, which is plenty to feel nervous about.</p><p>My advice is to start with shorter conversations with your camera in public and gradually build your way up to longer ones or save all your longer talks for when you’re in a more private setting. Short conversations may include one simple sentence about where you are going. Then, in another separate recording, in a different setting with different people, you can explain why you’re going there. If you’ve never broken up your speech like this for your vlogs, you might wonder if this will make your vlogs look disjointed. But this is actually a technique (below) that can enhance your vlogs.</p><p>As you continue to vlog in public more, you’ll become increasingly comfortable with it.</p><h3 id="2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others"><a href="#2-Fear-of-Being-Judged-by-Others" class="headerlink" title="2. Fear of Being Judged by Others"></a>2. Fear of Being Judged by Others</h3><p>After uploading your vlog online, the next thing you might worry about is being judged and criticized by anonymous haters on the internet. No matter how perfectly you present yourself, this will happen. But you will be ok.</p><p>You just need to be strongly grounded in your intrinsic worth and not take too seriously the judgments of those who don’t even know you. You can adjust your community settings on YouTube so that you have more control over others’ comments. But I suggest you just get used to others’ disapproval because it’s something that comes with putting yourself out there on such a public platform.</p><h3 id="3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough"><a href="#3-Fear-of-Not-Being-Interesting-Enough" class="headerlink" title="3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough"></a>3. Fear of Not Being Interesting Enough</h3><p>A lot of people fear that they aren’t interesting enough to watch. This fear stops many people from vlogging. Some people get around this self-doubt by focusing their content on something other than themselves. But people are so much more interesting than the tools and objects that they test out and review on YouTube. Even if you’re unable to secure the interest of the masses, there are bound to be a handful of people from all around the world who do find you interesting.</p><h3 id="4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough"><a href="#4-Fear-of-Your-Lifestyle-Not-Being-Exciting-Enough" class="headerlink" title="4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough"></a>4. Fear of Your Lifestyle Not Being Exciting Enough</h3><p>When you look at the vlogs of many of the top YouTubers, their lives appear so action-packed. It’s hard not to think that all vlogs are meant to be very stimulating. But if you believe that that is the standard for vlogs, you might either be discouraged and drop vlogging altogether or you might try too hard to schedule your life around getting stimulating vlog content. Neither is a good option. Face your fear of your audience getting bored and just go ahead and vlog your lifestyle just as it is.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111967/7443" target="_top" id="2111967">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111967" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111967/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity"><a href="#5-Fear-of-Losing-Your-Authenticity" class="headerlink" title="5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity"></a>5. Fear of Losing Your Authenticity</h3><p>When you have the ability to control what others see, you may be tempted to present yourself and your life in the most likable way to avoid disapproval and rejection. But the further away from your true self that you fabricate your story, the more inauthentic you’ll feel. Embrace disapproval and rejection and understand that, no matter how perfectly you present yourself, you just can’t avoid disapproval and rejection. It’s going to happen no matter what! So you might as well present yourself just as you are.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough"><a href="#6-Fear-of-Your-Production-Not-Being-Good-Enough" class="headerlink" title="6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough"></a>6. Fear of Your Production Not Being Good Enough</h3><p>Fearing that your production quality won’t measure up is another common fear that holds people back from vlogging. Just get started and put something together with the equipment and skills you already have. Loosen up a bit on your rigid high standards and experience for yourself that the consequences of doing your best with what you have are not so bad. You will develop your equipment and skills as you get more and more into vlogging.</p><h3 id="7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big"><a href="#7-Fear-of-Failing-To-Get-Big" class="headerlink" title="7. Fear of Failing To Get Big"></a>7. Fear of Failing To Get Big</h3><p>Getting a lot of subscribers is a common end goal for many who go into vlogging. This goal can seem impossible to reach with how crowded the vlogosphere has become with so many ambitious vloggers who are competing for views and subscribers.</p><p>How can you know for sure that you won’t be wasting your time and effort trying? The truth is… you can’t know for sure. But dismissing all of your time and effort as a waste just because you’re not at the end yet will take away from the joy you could have with vlogging. Rather than focusing on getting big, focus on enjoying the process of vlogging.</p><h3 id="8-Fear-of-Being-Distracted-From-the-Moment"><a href="#8-Fear-of-Being-Distracted-From-the-Moment" class="headerlink" title="8. Fear of Being Distracted From the Moment"></a>8. Fear of Being Distracted From the Moment</h3><p>Whether you’re vlogging or not, living in the present moment can already be a challenge with a smartphone. When something exhilarating happens, many of us feel compelled to pull out our phone to capture it, only to experience that fleeting moment through a small preview screen.</p><p>Vlogging appears to take that to another level, especially if you’re using complicated equipment that takes more time to set up and if you’re trying to capture enough footage to produce an entire vlog out of one day. How could all that time devoted to capturing your footage not get in the way of your present moment?</p><p>Well, like all hobbies, activities, and passions, vlogging does take time and you’re going to have to accept that it does. You may not know it now, but after giving vlogging a try, you may discover that you really enjoy it. And if you do, you won’t worry about missing out on life just as a painter who happens to be in the middle of his painting during a sunset wouldn’t worry about the sunset he’s missing out on.</p><p>If, in the end, you realize you don’t enjoy vlogging, then at least you’re left with a documented piece of a memory that you can relive again and again, which can actually help you appreciate your past moments even more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Fear-of-Making-Others-Uncomfortable"><a href="#9-Fear-of-Making-Others-Uncomfortable" class="headerlink" title="9. Fear of Making Others Uncomfortable"></a>9. Fear of Making Others Uncomfortable</h3><p>Even though you might have learned to enjoy and be comfortable with vlogging, your vlogging might make others uncomfortable. You can still vlog while respecting others’ boundaries by having a conversation first, before you start vlogging, around whether or not they feel comfortable with appearing in your vlog. You can then make sure to exclude those from your vlog who are uncomfortable with appearing in your vlog.</p><p>Sometimes, though, as much as you try to exclude certain people from your vlogs, they might still end up in your footage. You might even find out after you’ve captured great footage that people do not want to be in your video. In these cases, you can always censor their faces out in editing.</p><h3 id="10-Fear-of-Permanently-Leaving-a-Bad-Mark"><a href="#10-Fear-of-Permanently-Leaving-a-Bad-Mark" class="headerlink" title="10. Fear of Permanently Leaving a Bad Mark"></a>10. Fear of Permanently Leaving a Bad Mark</h3><p>Anything you make public over the internet, including vlogging, comes with the risk of making a permanent mark that won’t go away, even if you try to delete your original content later.

Assuming you already have made your mind on the editing software of choice, use the following steps to edit and export your completed work. To better demonstrate the steps of YouTube video editing, I’ll use Filmra9 video editor to edit YouTube Video.</p><h4 id="1-Split-or-combine-your-video-clips"><a href="#1-Split-or-combine-your-video-clips" class="headerlink" title="1.Split or combine your video clips"></a>1.Split or combine your video clips</h4><p>Most of the editing programs you use will have a timeline view of your work where you can easily cut or drop your shots. Each of the shots taken is actually a separate file which you will have to combine with others to make the video. The split feature in Filmora can cut footage into parts and then you can move it to desired position or just delete the unnecessary part. You can choose any part of the video quickly with the Quick Trim feature in preview. Besides, Filmora supports almost all popular video and photo formats, so there will be no obstacle when you want to combine footage shot with different devices. You can add photos to video or audio to video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-split.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Split Feature"                ></p><p>To combine several footages into one, just place all clips in the video track in order. Form the timeline view, move the shots around, cut, trim or shorten them as you desire. You can also add transitions between shots so that your final production may have a professional look.</p><h4 id="2-Crop-Rotate-Pan-Zoom"><a href="#2-Crop-Rotate-Pan-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is the time to add stuff such as texts, music and other special effect you may want to see on the video. If you are worried about doing this, just know that you don’t have to be a pro editor to do all these since most of the program will guide you through on how to add all the special effects.</p><h4 id="4-Save-and-export"><a href="#4-Save-and-export" class="headerlink" title="4.Save and export"></a>4.Save and export</h4><p>After you have done with adding all the special effects, choose the file format for saving your video then export it.

As a matter of fact, his popularity seems to be on the rise at the moment since his videos got over 3 billion views in the three years since he started his YouTube channel. However, this may only be a fluke and his popularity may plummet if he continues to produce shocking but mediocre videos.</p><p>His daredevil style has launched this 22-year old to YouTube stardom, but as time passes it will be hard for Logan to maintain this level of success.</p><h4 id="6-Felix-Arvid-Ulf-Kjellberg-YouTube-Channel-PewDiePie"><a href="#6-Felix-Arvid-Ulf-Kjellberg-YouTube-Channel-PewDiePie" class="headerlink" title="6.

The Swedish gaming commentator is probably one of the richest Internet celebrities because his net worth is estimated at between $30 and $50 million.</p><p>However, he seems to be past his prime, and for the second straight year, Felix’s annual income is declining. Aside from the work he’s done in the realm of gaming, the world’s most popular YouTuber has also published a book that sold more than 112,00 copies and he hosted a web series on YouTube Red titled Scare PewDiePie.</p><h4 id="7-Jake-Paul"><a href="#7-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="7.

Jake is only 22 and if he manages to avoid scandals and controversy he may stay among the richest YouTubers for the years to come.</p><h4 id="8-Daniel-Middleton-YouTube-Channel-DanTDM"><a href="#8-Daniel-Middleton-YouTube-Channel-DanTDM" class="headerlink" title="8.

Currently, the richest man on YouTube gaming channel has made his fortune on Minecraft videos, although Daniel Middleton, the owner of the most profitable channel on YouTube has also had quite a bit of success outside of the platform.</p><p>Daniel is from the United Kingdom and this British guy who was born in 1991 has published several comic books and starred in a number of TV shows (such as Skylanders Academy) and a YouTube Red Series, but the majority of his income still comes from the views he gets on his Minecraft videos, including gaming sponsorships and merchandise. He even has a second channel called MoreTDM though which was not active in recent years.</p><h4 id="9-Smosh"><a href="#9-Smosh" class="headerlink" title="9.

Over the years they have produced some iconic video-game music videos and parodies.</p><p>Smosh also has a number of ongoing web series that have attracted nearly 7 billion views and they have won numerous awards. In 2015 Smoosh: The Movie, was released, featuring Hecox and Padilla as themselves, but the film received only mild critical acclaim. Anthony Padilla stopped working on Smosh videos and started his own YouTube channel in 2017.</p><h4 id="10-Lilly-Singh-YouTube-Channel-IISuperwomanII"><a href="#10-Lilly-Singh-YouTube-Channel-IISuperwomanII" class="headerlink" title="10.

There is very little doubt that Lilly is indeed a superwoman because in 2021 her estimated earnings will surpass the $10 million mark.</p><p>This incredibly talented and beautiful Canadian has been producing YouTube videos since 2010, her videos have collected over 2 billion views. In addition to being a YouTube superstar, Lilly has also made appearances in feature films like Dr. Cabbie, Fahrenheit 451, or Bad Moms., to mention a few. Hopefully, her acting career will be as successful as her YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Young stars are born every day, but reaching the heights of the top ten highest-paid YouTubers requires patience, hard work, and most of all a stroke of luck. The world’s largest video-sharing platform offers great opportunities for young people who want to share their skills, thoughts, and ideas with the rest of the world, but it also demands a lot of creativity and dedication.

An AVI is a video container format that capture, store and play audio- videos. The AVI file extensions are abbreviated as .avi.</p><p>It was developed by Microsoft in 1992 and works based on Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Its users enjoy built-in support in every Microsoft Windows application.</p><p>AVI encodes its audio and video data on codecs like XviD, DivX and MPEG-2. A codec is a software or hardware used to compress or decompress digital video.</p><p>If you have limited storage, avoid AVI files because they are non-compressed and occupy large space.

You don’t have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don’t want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube’s music.</p><p>Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.</p><p>Even though this is critical for compensating artists, it already restricts the audience’s reach. Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don’t have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn’t have any of these problems.</p><p>YouTube’s other services are also free, making them accessible to everybody regardless of their financial position. This implies that you can access the site as long as you have a phone or a laptop. Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site’s potential for musical promotion.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?"></a>Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</h2><p>YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.</p><h4 id="Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit"><a href="#Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit"></a>Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit</h4><p>The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube’s blog and Google’s 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it’s a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube’s new 2 GB size restriction.</p><h4 id="What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube"><a href="#What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?"></a>What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?</h4><ul><li>YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.</li><li>Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.</li><li>Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to. It also allows for the creation of a unique ambiance with a more or less subtle background to elicit distinct emotions in the mind of an audiovisual production’s audience.</li><li>Music can play a vital influence in the success of a video.

The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube’s music policy comes into play.</p><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?"></a>How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</h2><p>At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Bouns!

Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don’t have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn’t have any of these problems.</p><p>YouTube’s other services are also free, making them accessible to everybody regardless of their financial position. This implies that you can access the site as long as you have a phone or a laptop. Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site’s potential for musical promotion.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube-3"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Necessary-To-Upload-Longer-Videos-And-Music-To-Youtube-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?"></a>Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?</h2><p>YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.</p><h4 id="Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit-3"><a href="#Standard-Accounts-Have-A-Time-Limit-3" class="headerlink" title="Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit"></a>Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit</h4><p>The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube’s blog and Google’s 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it’s a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube’s new 2 GB size restriction.</p><h4 id="What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube-3"><a href="#What-Are-The-Benefits-Of-Uploading-Music-Or-A-Song-On-Youtube-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?"></a>What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?</h4><ul><li>YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.</li><li>Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.</li><li>Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to. It also allows for the creation of a unique ambiance with a more or less subtle background to elicit distinct emotions in the mind of an audiovisual production’s audience.</li><li>Music can play a vital influence in the success of a video. The soundtrack can keep the viewer interested in the clip if the video itself is not entertaining.</li></ul><p><strong>How Can I Utilise Music Lawfully In My Youtube Videos?</strong></p><p>If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you’ll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube’s music policy comes into play.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484909/16446" target="_top" id="1484909">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484909" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484909/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-upload-your-music-to-YouTube-using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?"></a>How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?</h2><p>At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?"></a>Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?</h4><p>YouTube’s music library is relatively small. The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you’re adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you’ve ever wondered. On the surface, posting songs to YouTube may appear complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it’ll be a snap. When considering how to promote your music, YouTube should not be disregarded. It’s rare to have a free platform to distribute music on, so make use of it. With such a massive YouTube user base, your potential audience is enormous. Get your song on the platform and promote it as much as possible. You never know who might come upon your tunes until you’ve made them public. This concluded the tutorial on how to upload music to YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-10-power-players-youtubes-ladies-in-gaming/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved 10 Power Players YouTube's Ladies in Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-culinary-connoisseurs-must-watch-food-content/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Culinary Connoisseurs Must-Watch Food Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-efficiency-in-conversion-a-compact-list-of-the-top-10-video-transformers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Efficiency in Conversion A Compact List of the Top 10 Video Transformers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-infiltrating-the-top-channels-in-youtube-space/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Infiltrating the Top Channels in YouTube Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-youtubes-role-in-shaping-brands-and-collaborations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved YouTube's Role in Shaping Brands & Collaborations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/0-second-guide-to-fast-fortnite-graphics/"><u>[New] 30-Second Guide to Fast Fortnite Graphics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-high-quality-power-units-for-gopro-hero5-genuine-sources-and-copycats/"><u>[New] High-Quality Power Units for GoPro Hero5 Genuine Sources & Copycats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-block-spontaneous-youtube-video-triggers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Block Spontaneous YouTube Video Triggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-motion-assessment-2023/"><u>[Updated] In-Depth Motion Assessment 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/effective-solutions-for-26e-wi-fi-adapters-usb-connectivity-woes-on-windows-pcs/"><u>Effective Solutions for 26E Wi-Fi Adapter's USB Connectivity Woes on Windows PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/enabling-gmails-additional-layer-of-protection-through-2fa/"><u>Enabling Gmail's Additional Layer of Protection Through 2FA</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/-level-expenditure-cost-effective-platforms-for-youtube-purchases-for-2024/"><u>Entry-Level Expenditure Cost-Effective Platforms for YouTube Purchases for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Oppo A18 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129739/7443" target="_top" id="2129739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049370/7443" target="_top" id="2049370">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049370" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049370/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5. Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Prepared"><a href="#6-Be-Prepared" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Prepared"></a><strong>6. Be Prepared</strong></h2><p>While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.</p><p>Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…</p><p>Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.</p><p>Take a look at <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w" >Ashley Nichole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.</p><h2 id="7-Be-Expressive"><a href="#7-Be-Expressive" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Expressive"></a><strong>7. Be Expressive</strong></h2><p>Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.</p><p>If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.</p><p>Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.</p><p>Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera? Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg" >Emma Chamberlain <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, if you haven’t already. Every word she says in her video is layered with emotion.

Stay Organized"></a><strong>8. Stay Organized</strong></h2><p>The same way you should prepare before filming, it’s also important to be organized comes the editing phase. Editing is arguably the most time-consuming part of the vlogging process, so have a system for categorizing and finding your footages.</p><p>This is especially important when you have multiple video and audio files and if you are capturing footage over a number of days or in different locations.</p><p>Additionally, while filming your vlog, you are going to mess up. It’s also helpful to add a cue after you messed up, this can be a sound cue that causes the levels to spike (clapping or snapping your fingers work) or a video cue such as a dramatic gesture to the camera. When skipping through your footage to find the part where you messed up, later on, it’s easier to have a mark to help you locate it.</p><p>Vlogging is hard, so don’t make more work for yourself. Learn little tricks to make life easier for yourself at every step.</p><p>The more organized you are the more attention you can put into the creative aspect of vlogging, and less time finding a video file or syncing audio to video.</p><p>There you have it, 8 tips to help you vlog like the pros. Anyone can vlog. But only until you point a camera at yourself in public for the first time, do you realize how uncomfortable vlogging can be.</p><p>Even filming yourself in your room with the door closed — and nobody is in the house with you — can be a challenge for beginning vloggers. If you find watching your first few videos to be cringy, don’t be discouraged. There are <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >fears of vlogging, but you can overcome them <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Take a look at some of the <a class="link"   href="http://tubularinsights.com/throwback-thursday-first-videos-from-youtubes-top-stars/" >first videos from popular YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can see that everyone had a starting point.</p><p>Do you have any vlogging tricks of your own?

Get the best pictures with the Sony DSC WX350. This camera offers both still photos and video recording, using technology that minimizes how much the camera shakes, even if you’re filming on the go.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The image stabilizer makes this one of the best cameras for making YouTube videos out there, alongside of the 20x optical zoom. The battery life is quite long as well, which means you can get a lot of content done without any problems. Lastly, you can film in HD, which makes any YouTube influencer happy.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The LED screen can be quite dim, so it’s hard to see it when you’re out in bright sunlight; be sure you make adjustments before you go outside. There is also not your typical viewfinder installed, so experienced videographers may not like using it.</p><h3 id="2-GoPro-HERO8-Action-Camera-Best-Wearable-Sports-Camera"><a href="#2-GoPro-HERO8-Action-Camera-Best-Wearable-Sports-Camera" class="headerlink" title="2.

With their HERO series of GoPros, they have all sorts of great features that allow you to capture the smoothest video, even when you’re out and on the go. Their <a class="link"   href="https://fstoppers.com/apps/best-way-stabilize-your-gopro-heros-footage-391418" >top end stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> makes their cameras the best for the active YouTuber.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The rugged, waterproof design of the HERO7 is a great option for anyone who is looking to be on the go with their YouTube. The integrated mount makes it simple for anyone who wants to put it on a selfie stick or something else, and it even has a companion app for easy, on the go editing!</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The Wi-Fi capabilities are great, but the video transfer can take a bit of time due to how large the files may be. So, if you’re uploading the transfer, you may want to consider using the USB port instead. Also, the memory card slot is in an awkward place near the mount, so those with larger fingers may have trouble putting a card in there.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115946/19272" target="_top" id="2115946">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115946" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115946/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Logitech-BRIO-HD-Webcam-for-Video-–-Best-Video-Recording-and-Streaming-Camera"><a href="#3-Logitech-BRIO-HD-Webcam-for-Video-–-Best-Video-Recording-and-Streaming-Camera" class="headerlink" title="3.

With multiple features and a design that has been made for streamers like you, you’ll always be able to just turn it on, make adjustments with ease, and get streaming in no time.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The camera is incredibly easy to use and install; it connects to your PC with a USB type C to USB type 3.0 cord (backwards compatible to 2.0). You can easily tinker with all of the settings and such in the included software.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The arm is designed for thick edges; those with flat monitors or borderless monitors may find that it’s difficult to attach it to your monitor. The software is easy to use, but it’s missing a handful of settings that more experienced streamers would want to have available. There is a crop out background feature, but it can be hard to find and use.</p><h3 id="4-PANASONIC-Lumix-G7-4K-Digital-Camera-Best-Mirrorless-Camera-for-Professionals"><a href="#4-PANASONIC-Lumix-G7-4K-Digital-Camera-Best-Mirrorless-Camera-for-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="4.

All of the controls make it easy to get things the way that you want it, and it comes with multiple ports so that you can plug it into any device and get it ready to go.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> This one of the best 4k video options out there, and you don’t need to spend an arm and a leg on it. The dual control dials and the variable touch LCD allow for maximum control, making it simple to film what you want with minimal editing after you’ve filmed.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> There is a tracking focus, which can be good, but it makes the burst rate (which helps with motion blur) a lot slower.

You’ve also probably noticed that when you looking for royalty-free music or stock footage a lot of it is licensed through creative commons.</p><p>So, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what exactly are creative commons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</p><p>To hold the copyright to a creative work means that you own it, and anybody who wants to use your work for anything (i.e. uses a song you composed in their YouTube video) has to do so on your terms. When you license your work through creative commons you do not give up your rights to your creative work (a common misconception).</p><p>When you use a creative commons license you are outlining the terms under which other creators are allowed to use your creations in their projects for free if they credit you for your work.</p><p>If you do not want anyone using your work for free in any context, you stick to traditional copyrighting.</p><p>But if you’ve created a piece of music, a photograph, or a clip that you wouldn’t mind other people using, potentially as a way to get your name out there, you might want to consider creative commons.</p><p>There are 6 different creative commons licenses. Which is right for you will depend on your answers to these two questions:</p><p>Are you okay with a creator making money off of something they create using your work?</p><p>Are you okay with a creator producing a derivative of your work?</p><p>To say ‘no derivatives’ is to say ‘I’m okay with people using it, so long as they don’t change it’. One example of a derivative is a techno remix of a song. If you are alright with other creators making derivatives of your work, you may also want to require them to ‘ShareAlike’. ShareAlike means that the creator of that techno remix of your song has to use the same creative commons license you used for your original to distribute the remix.</p><p>An example of a derivative someone might make of a YouTube video would be auto-tuning it to make a song or cutting up your video to make one that’s just ‘the funny parts’.</p><p>Here are the 6 creative commons licenses, and a chart you can use as a quick reference tool.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Attribution-–-CC-BY"><a href="#Attribution-–-CC-BY" class="headerlink" title="Attribution – CC BY"></a>Attribution – CC BY</h2><p>If you’re using music or other media with this license, all you need to do is credit the artist.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can do whatever they like with any element of it (video or sound) so long as they credit you. I.e. if someone wanted to mute your clips and use you as stock footage in a bigger project, they could.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Attribution-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-SA"><a href="#Attribution-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-SA" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-ShareAlike – CC BY-SA"></a>Attribution-ShareAlike – CC BY-SA</h2><p>If you use music, photos, or any other media licensed this way, then you must both credit the artist and license your video this same way. Meaning, you can’t use YouTube’s standard license and must instead allow for others to use your work the way you are using the licensed media.</p><p>If you apply this license to your video, you’re saying you don’t mind people using all or portions of your video for their project so long as they allow others to use their work in the same way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130531/26400" target="_top" id="2130531">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130531" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130531/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Attribution-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-ND"><a href="#Attribution-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-ND" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NoDerivs – CC BY-ND"></a>Attribution-NoDerivs – CC BY-ND</h2><p>This one can get tricky.</p><p>Essentially, you can use media licensed this way so long as you don’t alter it or create a different version. For example, you can’t take a song licensed this way and use it in a mashup with another song. That part is clear. Where it gets tricky is when you want to use a song in your video.</p><p>Under normal copyright rules, using a royalty-free song in the background of your video would not count as creating a derivative. The definition of derivative according to creative commons is a bit broader and includes ‘syncing’. This means you can’t take an ‘Attribution-NoDerivs’ song and create any kind of music video for it.</p><p>For example, you can’t edit clips of yourself snowboarding so that they’re in sync with a song that has this license.</p><p>Whether or not you can play the song in the background of your vlog while you are speaking can be a bit of a grey area. In theory, it shouldn’t be a problem, but if you’re accessing the music through a social site like SoundCloud then it might be best to ask the artist first.</p><p>There’s no reason to license your YouTube videos this way. If people cannot alter your video, all that’s left is for them to repost it. Even though they’d also be crediting you, they’d still essentially be stealing views and ad revenue from your original video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Attribution-NonCommercial-–-CC-BY-NC"><a href="#Attribution-NonCommercial-–-CC-BY-NC" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NonCommercial – CC BY-NC"></a>Attribution-NonCommercial – CC BY-NC</h2><p>If you’re using stock footage, music, or stock photos licensed this way then you should still be able to monetize your video. YouTube monetization and commercial use are different things. However, there is a lot of confusion about this issue, and chances are the rights holder intends for this license to mean ‘no monetization’.</p><p>What you definitely could not do with a NonCommercial license is to use the song&#x2F;other media in an actual commercial for a product, including product placement that a brand is paying you for.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can use it in whatever way they like so long as they credit you and don’t try to make money off of it. Once again, that doesn’t mean they can’t use it in a YouTube video which they monetize because, technically, they’d be making money off of the ad that ran ahead of the video and not the video itself.</p><p>The thing to be careful of with this license is that it’s not ‘ShareAlike’. So, if you license your video this way somebody could use your clips as stock footage and then provide them - as part of their project – for free to a third person to use in a project they were making money off of.</p><h2 id="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-NC-SA"><a href="#Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike-–-CC-BY-NC-SA" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike – CC BY-NC-SA"></a>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike – CC BY-NC-SA</h2><p>Music and other media with an ‘Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike’ license can be used in and altered for your videos, so long as you aren’t making money off those videos. You must also use this same license for the video you create using elements licensed this way.</p><p>If you license your video this way, people can use it or a portion of it in their project if they credit you. They must also use this same license for their video if they do. This protects you from the situation where a third person who never licensed your original content is making money off of it.</p><h2 id="Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-NC-ND"><a href="#Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs-–-CC-BY-NC-ND" class="headerlink" title="Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs – CC BY-NC-ND"></a>Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs – CC BY-NC-ND</h2><p>There aren’t many situations where you would be using media licensed this way in your YouTube videos. You can’t alter it, sync videos to it, or make money from any video that uses it.</p><p>You also probably shouldn’t use this license for your videos. ‘NoDerivs’ means there are not many ways people could use your content, except to repost full videos and steal your views.</p><h2 id="Edit-Video-with-the-Most-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a href="#Edit-Video-with-the-Most-Excellent-Video-Editor"

YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.</p><p>For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title"><a href="#2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.</p><p>When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video.

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148647/16836" target="_top" id="2148647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148647/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1936838">                    <video width="374" height="48" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1936838">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:234px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcoinrule.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1936838%2F18409'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1936838/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1.

Recent Video Data"></a>2. Recent Video Data</h4><p>See data and improvement tips for your latest video. If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving.

It’s great for modeling and animation, and you can even use it to make your YouTube intros.</p><p>This is an extremely powerful program. You can create cartoons and video game prototypes in Blender. This does mean that it’s probably not realistic for someone with no experience in animation to jump in and make a quick intro for their YouTube channel. However, if you want to learn Blender, all of the information you need is easily accessible through the tutorials on their site.</p><p>What’s a bit more realistic than learning an entire animation suite to make an intro is to download a premade template and just customize it in Blender. You can find YouTube intro templates that are editable in Blender on YouTube and <a href="#velosofy">Velosofy</a>.</p><h4 id="Movietools"><a href="#Movietools" class="headerlink" title="Movietools"></a><a class="link"   href="http://www.movietools.info/" >Movietools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a great site where you can download all kinds of free resources including video loops and animated backgrounds you can use to build YouTube intros.</p><p>You cannot download a complete Intro with your own text and&#x2F;or logo from Movietools the way you can with Panzoid, but they can provide most of the resources you would need to build a sequence in Filmora or another editor.</p><p>Downloads from Movietools come as WMV (Windows Media) or MP4 files.</p><h4 id="Panzoid"><a href="#Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="Panzoid"></a><a class="link"   href="https://panzoid.com/" >Panzoid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p> For a lot of creators, Panzoid is the default site they go to for YouTube intros, and that’s with good reason. Panzoid has an endless supply of intro templates (new ones are created weekly by members of their community) which you can edit right on the site.</p><p>A lot of the intro templates on Panzoid include music, and almost all of them include 3D text.</p><p>Click on a template you like and then click ‘open in clipmaker’.</p><p>In the clipmaker, you’ll be able to edit the template however you like. The main change you’ll want to make will probably be to the text – you’ll want it to say your channel name. In the menu on the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon that looks like a cube. Click on it to bring up a list of the objects in the sequence.</p><p>The text will probably be under a heading such as ‘Group: All’, although there may be some variation on this depending on who built the template. Look for something that says ‘Group: Text’ in one of the dropdown menus and then look at where it says ‘Text: (the text from the template)’. There will probably be at least two fields like this for one word&#x2F;line (they’re layers of the same thing). Make sure to edit them all to say the same thing or your intro will look odd.</p><p>Click the icon that looks like an arrow pointing down to choose your quality (next to mode) and format before you export. The highest quality will make your clip slow to download, but that could be worth it since you’ll probably get a lot of use out of this clip and you only need to download it once.</p><h4 id="Velosofy"><a href="#Velosofy" class="headerlink" title="Velosofy"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.velosofy.com/" >Velosofy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Velosofy has a ton of great intro templates you can download for free. The only complication is that the downloads are project files for programs like Sony Vegas or After Effects, making it difficult to use them unless you have those programs.</p><p>Luckily, one of the programs Velosofy has intro downloads for is <a href="#blender">Blender</a>, the free animation software discussed above. You can download YouTube intro templates from Velosofy to edit in Blender and end up with a great custom intro for free.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130886/7443" target="_top" id="2130886">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130886" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130886/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Intro"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Intro" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Making a Great Intro"></a>5 Tips for Making a Great Intro</h2><p>Here are some tips for making an intro that supports the growth of your YouTube channel.</p><h4 id="1-Keep-it-Under-10-Seconds"><a href="#1-Keep-it-Under-10-Seconds" class="headerlink" title="1.

Ten seconds is the longest you can get away with, and that’s only if your intro is exciting and includes a lot of movement and music.</p><p>Five seconds will be better than 10 seconds in most cases.</p><h4 id="2-Match-Your-Channel’s-Branding"><a href="#2-Match-Your-Channel’s-Branding" class="headerlink" title="2. Match Your Channel’s Branding"></a>2. Match Your Channel’s Branding</h4><p>Your intro should help to strengthen your personal brand by using the same kinds of colors and fonts found in your channel art and thumbnails.</p><p>Beyond matching your visuals, your intro should support the general tone of your channel. If you tend to be upbeat in your videos, upbeat music and brighter colors are probably best. If you’re a tech channel, something sleek with a black background could be better.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Music"><a href="#3-Use-Music" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Music"></a>3. Use Music</h4><p>Viewers are likely to get distracted and click away during silent pauses. In order to keep their attention through your intro, you’ll need to include music, and maybe even a sound effect.</p><h4 id="4-Include-Your-Channel-Name"><a href="#4-Include-Your-Channel-Name" class="headerlink" title="4. Include Your Channel Name"></a>4. Include Your Channel Name</h4><p>This might seem basic, but there are intros out there where the creator has overlooked this. One of the main purposes of your intro is to brand your video, so there’s nothing more important than including your channel name.</p><h4 id="5-Introduce-Your-Topic-Before-Your-Intro"><a href="#5-Introduce-Your-Topic-Before-Your-Intro" class="headerlink" title="5. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro"></a>5. Introduce Your Topic Before Your Intro</h4><p>Instead of putting your intro at the very beginning of your video, put a short clip ahead of it where you explain your topic. A viewer that is looking for you to get to the point quickly might click away if the first thing they see is the intro instead of information relevant to their search.</p><p> What’s your YouTube intro like?

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068439/7443" target="_top" id="2068439">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068439" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068439/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimization Tips"></a>1. Optimization Tips</h4><p>In the past, there has been a lot of speculations about how creators should treat their video titles and descriptions. Well, now YouTube is letting you know exactly which area to focus on. Simply hover over any “?” icon to see the advice and click “Learn More” to go to YouTube Creator Academy to get more details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-optimization.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Beta Optimization Tips"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082521/7443" target="_top" id="2082521">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082521" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082521/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Recent-Video-Data"><a href="#2-Recent-Video-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Recent Video Data"></a>2. Recent Video Data</h4><p>See data and improvement tips for your latest video. If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151892/7443" target="_top" id="2151892">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151892" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151892/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043662/7443" target="_top" id="2043662">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043662" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043662/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving.

But, slow down, you have to edit all your clips together first. And then you have to export your video from the editing program, which can take a while. Then you have to wait for it to upload to YouTube, and once it’s up you have to write your description, add cards, and do a handful of other things.</p><p>The period between finishing a video and actually posting it for your subscribers to see can be long and tiresome. A lot of videos have probably died in these stages because their creators ran out of energy and patience.</p><p>Don’t let this happen to your videos! Here are 4 ways you can save time and avoid headaches during post-production:</p><p><a href="#miniproject">1. Create mini-projects</a></p><p><a href="#optimize">2. Optimize your upload speed</a></p><p><a href="#descriptiontags">3. Use default descriptions and tags</a></p><p><a href="#tubebuddy">4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Create-mini-projects"><a href="#1-Create-mini-projects" class="headerlink" title="1. Create mini-projects"></a>1. Create mini-projects</h2><p>When you have a<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >large editing project <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with lots of different titles, animations, clip sequences, and PIP tracks it can get hard to keep track of everything. That’s especially true if you need to go back and make changes. A change to one part of your video could affect other parts of it.</p><p>Also, the more complex your video is the longer it will take to render&#x2F;export.</p><p>There is a way you can keep your project more organized, save time making minor adjustments, and speed up rendering: create sub-projects of different segments of your video and import them into your main project as their own clips.</p><p>This helps you in 3 ways:</p><p>1. If there are a lot of effects it’ll be faster to render a shorter video.</p><p>2. If you import your sequence as its own clip you won’t have to worry about adjusting little parts of it whenever you change earlier sections of your video.</p><p>3. If you do want to make adjustments to your sequence you can open up your mini-project and change it without affecting anything in your main project.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Optimize-your-upload-speed"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-upload-speed" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your upload speed"></a>2. Optimize your upload speed</h2><p>At home, your videos will upload fastest if all of your internet resources are devoted to the upload. That means you should not have any other windows open on your computer while you are uploading. You should also make sure there aren’t other devices competing for wifi like smart tvs, cell phones, or really fancy coffee makers.</p><p>If you have neighbors on the same wifi signal as you and they are online at the same time, this will slow you down too.</p><p>Because there is so much that can interfere with wifi, you might want to consider a wired Ethernet cable. Ethernet connections are faster in general, and you won’t have any problems with other devices competing for resources like you get with wifi.</p><p>If you’re doing everything you can to optimize your upload speed at home and still find that it takes an unreasonable amount of time to upload videos to YouTube, go somewhere with a better connection. Save your video to a USB drive and take it to a library or college to upload. Connections in these kinds of places tend to be very strong.</p><h2 id="3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags"><a href="#3-Use-default-descriptions-and-tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Use default descriptions and tags"></a>3. Use default descriptions and tags</h2><p>In your <strong>Creator Studio</strong>, go to <strong>Channel &gt; Upload</strong> <strong>defaults</strong>. Here you can write in titles, descriptions, and tags which will automatically be applied to every video you upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-defaults.jpg"                      alt="Creator Studio Upload Defaults"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136612/26400" target="_top" id="2136612">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136612" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136612/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Note: in the latest YouTube Studio, the upload interface is changed but the main process is similar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Upload video in YouTube Studio"                ></p><p>You probably have tags you use for almost every video you post. For example, if your channel is about vegan cooking then every one of your videos is probably tagged ‘vegan’, ‘food’, and ‘cooking’. If you type those tags in here then you don’t have to keep adding them to every new video, and you can still add or remove tags from individual uploads so you aren’t stuck using the exact same set of tags every time.</p><p>Similarly, you probably have some default text that goes in the description of every one of your videos (i.e. a link to your personal website or a brief introduction of yourself). If you type in a default description then that text will appear automatically in every new video description and you can just add to it when you need to for individual videos.</p><p>Using defaults might only save you a couple of minutes per video, but those minutes add up.</p><h2 id="4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools"><a href="#4-TubeBuddy’s-bulk-features-and-tagging-tools" class="headerlink" title="4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools"></a>4. TubeBuddy’s bulk features and tagging tools</h2><p>TubeBuddy is a channel management tool for YouTube. Most of its features are more geared towards very large channels or companies with a YouTube presence, but there are also features that can help small or mid-sized YouTubers save time and stay organized.</p><p>Some of these tools include templates for things like cards and end screens and bulk processing tools for when you want to change a lot of things at once. For example, if you wanted to update the links in every card in every one of your videos at once then TubeBuddy could help with that.</p><p>Some of TubeBuddy’s best features for growing channels are the tagging features. TubeBuddy will help you discover tags, suggest new tags, and even copy whole lists of tags from rival videos.</p><p>There are different <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/pricing" >levels of pricing for TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (including a free version, although it’s very limited) and you get a discount on the Pro version if you have less than 50,000 lifetime views on your channel. It ends up being $4.50USD a month (or $3.60 USD a month if you pay for a year in advance). It’s a good investment for someone who’s starting to see some growth on YouTube, but probably not if you’re still trying to reach milestones like 500 subs or 10,000 views.</p><p>You have to work hard to get anywhere on YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you should be toiling away at tedious stuff like typing in the same tags over and over. If you have any time-saving tips then make sure to share them with everyone in the comments!</p><p> <em>Remember that your time is valuable &#x3D;)</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-youtube-in-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="upload video to YouTube inFilmora9 "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975555">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975555">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975555%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975555/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are using Filmora to edit YouTube videos, you can upload the video to YouTube directly from Filmora without download it again first, which can save you time.

It is understandable that there will be a learning curve if you just want to get tons of subscribers on your channel – who doesn’t? Ultimately, in getting a standard video that will attract and sustain the interest of the viewers, you will need to employ certain strategies that will enhance your credibility.</p><p>Let’s tell each other the truth, no one wants to watch a video that is not aesthetically appealing even if it is a close friend. So, if you have got the relevant content and the video to pull traffic to your channel, what you will need is editing software that will help you make the correct adjustments to your video</p><p>Nobody wants a random viewer to comment “This video is a little bit tacky, touch-up properly”, that will definitely leave a sting. As such, understand the best technique that works for you as well as the software that meets your needs based on the current level of expertise. It is okay for you to grow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/advanced%20video%20cutter.png"                      alt="advanced%20video%20cutter"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have"><a href="#Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have" class="headerlink" title="Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have"></a>Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have</h2><p>As much as the enthusiasm is brewing to get on your mac and upload the video you just shot, there are certain elements you need to implement to make a cool video for YouTube. Beginners sometimes feel their content is the best, the excitement of posting their very first series can be overwhelming. Sometimes, it blocks off other ideas for making the video better.</p><p>However, having amazing content dies not to exclude the need for the right editing technique. Here are five methods for editing your YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="1-Control-the-video-duration"><a href="#1-Control-the-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="1.Control the video duration"></a>1.Control the video duration</h3><p>The length of a particular scene can have different meanings depending on how long or short it is in a video. This means the duration can impact the message you are trying to pass across to your viewers, hence it is important to know what places to accelerate and cut in the video.</p><p>You can have a system where each part of the content is labeled in their order of importance such as A, B, C. This means from the most important to the least important.

Creating an intro that is captivating and appealing to drag the audience to your video is an important technique for editing your videos. Also, the end of the video, from the signing out to the closing montage has to appeal to the audience. You will be surprised by the number of people that love seeing end credits if the closing montage is good. Customize the intro and the end of the video so the audience is tuned all through.</p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best YouTube Banner Size and Channel Art Dimension (The Ultimate Guide) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Add Logo or Watermark to YouTube Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151871/7443" target="_top" id="2151871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters"><a href="#3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters" class="headerlink" title="3.Use Cool transitions or filters"></a>3.Use Cool transitions or filters</h3><p>If there is anything the audience love to see, it is the way you move from different points in the vudeo.
