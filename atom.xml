What’s wrong with simply focusing on ads?</p><p>More and more people are making a living by creating videos on YouTube. According to the <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2018/01/additional-changes-to-youtube-partner.html" >YouTube Partner Program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, YouTube has seen a 40% year-over-year of channels making 6 figures from viewer ads engagements.</p><h2 id="Best-YouTube-Video-Editor–Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-YouTube-Video-Editor–Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best YouTube Video Editor–Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best YouTube Video Editor–Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Over thousands of hours of content are uploaded on YouTube every day and people are going crazy to earn money with video monetization. There should be a minimum time gap between your video shoot, editing, and uploading it to your channel. Wondershare Filmora Video Editor can help you get your videos edited faster. Not only the interface is simple and intuitive, it has both the basic and professional editing tools such as cutting, trimming, crop&amp;zoom, a large collection of video effects and royalty-free music, and you can also upload the video directly on YouTube after editing. All of these make Filmora stand out in the queue and become a favorite tool to edit YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-YouTube-Partner-Program-YPP"><a href="#What-is-the-YouTube-Partner-Program-YPP" class="headerlink" title="What is the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?"></a><strong>What is the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization---the-ultimate-guide-to-ad-revenue-422.html" >YPP enables YouTubers to make money from an advertisement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that appears before or during their videos.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Money-Can-YouTubers-Make-from-Ads"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Can-YouTubers-Make-from-Ads" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Can YouTubers Make from Ads?"></a><strong>How Much Money Can YouTubers Make from Ads?</strong></h2><p>The answer to this question varies depending on the channel and the audience, as YouTubers don’t make money for views but rather from how often people engage with the ads. If a viewer watches more than 30 seconds of the ad or clicks it, then the YouTuber will make money.</p><p>This is a general estimate of how much a YouTuber can make from ads once they qualify:</p><p>- 68% of advertisers ad spend goes to the video creator. If advertisers spend $100, creators get $68.</p><p>- $0.18 is the average rate per ad view.</p><p>- 1000 ad views will equal approximately $18</p><p>- 1000 video views will equal between $2-$5</p><h2 id="Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads"><a href="#Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads"></a><strong>Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads</strong></h2><p>For new YouTubers, it is getting harder and harder to get to that point where their sole income can be from YouTube ads. Before they can make a penny, they must first qualify.</p><h4 id="Monetization-Rules-as-of-January-2018"><a href="#Monetization-Rules-as-of-January-2018" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Rules ( as of January 2018"></a><strong>Monetization Rules (</strong> <strong>as of January 2018</strong></h4><p>- Creators need 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of view time in 12 months before they can turn on monetization</p><p>- YouTube pays in $100 increments</p><p> Once they have monetization turned on, it’s only the beginning. YouTubers need to create good content consistently. In order to earn $100 for the initial payout, they need an average of 50,000 views. That’s just $100! A lot of views and not a big payout. Hardly enough to quit your day job.</p><p>That is why it is essential to have alternative ways to make money on YouTube, and not rely on the ads shown on your videos. So, without further ado, here are 4 other ways to make money on YouTube:</p><h2 id="1-Sell-Your-Product-or-Service"><a href="#1-Sell-Your-Product-or-Service" class="headerlink" title="1. Sell Your Product or Service:"></a><strong>1. Sell Your Product or Service:</strong></h2><p>YouTube is one of the most effective means of marketing and selling your products and services if you are able to use it effectively and drive people to click and buy.</p><p>Here are some examples of products and services you can offer:</p><h4 id="Products"><a href="#Products" class="headerlink" title="Products:"></a><strong>Products:</strong></h4><p>- eBooks</p><p>- Artwork</p><p>- Licensed content</p><p>- Online course</p><p>- Channel&#x2F;brand merchandise</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jack-paul1.jpg"                      alt="YouTuber Jake Paul"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Jake Paul uses eCommerce platform</em> <a href="https://fanjoy.co/collections/"><em>Fanjoy</em></a> <em>to sell his merch.</em></p><h4 id="Services"><a href="#Services" class="headerlink" title="Services:"></a><strong>Services:</strong></h4><p>- Consulting work (strategy planner, financial advisor, etc.)</p><p>- Contracting work (designer, developer, etc.)</p><p>- Education (tutor, trainer, etc.)</p><p>- Performance&#x2F;Speaking Opportunities (motivational speaker, musician, etc.)</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sunny-lenarduzzi2.jpg"                      alt="YouTuber Sunny Lenarduzzi"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber and entrepreneur, Sunny Lenarduzzi uses YouTube as a platform to get clients for her consulting business.</em></p><h4 id="How-to-Sell-a-Product-or-Service-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Sell-a-Product-or-Service-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Sell a Product or Service on YouTube"></a><strong>How to Sell a Product or Service on YouTube</strong></h4><p>YouTube is a vast platform and if you don’t have a clear direction for what you are selling, you might be making videos for an audience that isn’t interested in buying what you are selling.</p><p>Here is how you should go about selling your product or service on YouTube:</p><p> <strong>1. Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well. Have a clear call to action somewhere on your website. This is where your viewers become customers.</p><h4 id="But-What-if-You-Don’t-Have-a-Product-Or-Service-to-Sell-Yet"><a href="#But-What-if-You-Don’t-Have-a-Product-Or-Service-to-Sell-Yet" class="headerlink" title="But What if You Don’t Have a Product Or Service to Sell Yet?"></a><strong>But What if You Don’t Have a Product Or Service to Sell Yet?</strong></h4><p>While some YouTubers certainly start with their product and service in mind and find their customers to sell through YouTube, many others go the opposite way and discover their audience first.</p><p>Lilly Singh did not start a YouTube channel to sell her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/How-Be-Bawse-Guide-Conquering/dp/0385689306"><em>How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life</em></a>. Her YouTube channel gave her an audience and proved to publishers that there was enough demand for her to write a book that people will read.</p><p> As you <a class="link"   href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/get-more-youtube-subscribers-increase-video-views/" >grow your audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will find that there will be a demand for certain products or services that don’t already exist. This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers. Remi created a beauty brand and DIY face mask, <a class="link"   href="https://shophoneypop.com/" >Honey Pop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which could only have happened after taking the time to understand her supportive audience.</p><h2 id="2-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#2-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="2. Affiliate Marketing:"></a><strong>2. Affiliate Marketing:</strong></h2><p>Businesses know that there are more eyes watching YouTube than ever — behind Google, YouTube is the second most popular place for people researching what to buy — and influencers and reviews are an effective method of getting sales. You can leverage that by participating in affiliate marketing as a YouTuber.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube"><a href="#How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?"></a><strong>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>As a YouTuber, you can share your thoughts on products or services, and if there are products that you recommend, by simply adding a personalized link to the product page, you can get a commission for every sale of that product that came through your link.</p><p>The average affiliate commission rate is between 5% to 30%, with a lot of variables. Some low price range items will have a higher commission, while higher-priced items will have lower commissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliat-link8.jpg"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><p><em>Travel YouTuber,</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SorelleIAm"><em>Sorelle Amore</em></a> <em>’s affiliate links to her vlogging gears.</em></p><p> Keep in mind that people are most likely going to take recommendations from people they trust. You wouldn’t buy a computer from a nutritionist and you wouldn’t buy vitamins from a gamer, so consider what you are an expert in and what products you have the most authority to speak about.</p><h4 id="What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?"></a><strong>What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?</strong></h4><p>There are no restrictions on what will make a good affiliate marketing video, but there are best practices.</p><p>What’s important is understanding the purpose of the video. If the video is about vlogging microphones, then it makes complete sense to have an affiliate link to your favorite microphone. Odds are the people who are watching the video may be considering buying a new microphone, so the link is helpful for them.</p><p>Here are a few types of videos that make for good affiliate marketing opportunities:</p><p>- Product reviews</p><p>- Top 10</p><p>- How-tos</p><p>- Cheap vs expensive</p><p>- What to pack for…</p><p> <strong>How to Get an Affiliate Marketing Link for YouTube?</strong></p><p>Which affiliate marketing program you choose to sign up with will depend on the products you want to link to through your content. Do some research on what each network has to offer in regards to your niche.</p><p>Here is the list of 4 popular affiliate marketing networks:</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" >Amazon Associates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://rakutenmarketing.com/affiliate" >Rakuten <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.shareasale.com/" >ShareASale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://peerfly.com/" >PeerFly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can also partner with brands directly as many of them, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.sephora.com/affiliates" >Sephora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/affiliate-program" >Canon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, will have their own affiliate program.</p><h2 id="3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships"><a href="#3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:"></a><strong>3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:</strong></h2><p>Selling out, that is often the thought when we hear creators getting brand deals and sponsorships, but that stigma is unfounded if the brand and the content are properly aligned. As your channel grows, you will begin to recognize brands that match your values — and the values of your viewers — and those that don’t.</p><p>Today, more and more brands are collaborating with YouTube creators, because <a class="link"   href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/youtube-influencer-marketing-rulebook/" >creators are 4x more effective in earning brand familiarity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than collaborations with traditional celebrities.</p><p>In an ad for Beats by Dre’s #BuiltForBosses campaign, YouTuber <a class="link"   href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-self-made-star-shows-one-way-to-crack-the-gen-z-code-1511719567?mod=e2tw" >Liza Koshy outperformed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the likes of Tom Brady and DJ Khaled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perform-the-likes9.jpg"                      alt="perform the likes"                ></p><p>While it does take significant effort on YouTube to acquire a following, it is possible for a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers to get a brand deal. Getting the buy-in from brands is a numbers game, and according to <a class="link"   href="https://videocreators.com/how-to-get-started-with-brand-deals-on-youtube/" >Video Creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the minimal number of views per video shouldn’t be lower than 2,000 if this is the path you want to head in.</p><h4 id="How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands"><a href="#How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Discovered By Brands"></a><strong>How to Get Discovered By Brands</strong></h4><p>The decision-makers behind brands might not be aware of influencers with a smaller following — those who have just cracked the 5,000 subscriber mark. The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results. This type of independence is what makes YouTube influencer marketing special.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="4-Crowdfunding"><a href="#4-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="4. Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>4. Crowdfunding:</strong></h2><p>If you are creating valuable content and have a loyal following, you can start thinking about crowdfunding. It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5? What did they say?</p><p>“What do you need it for?”</p><p>We are more willing to give money if we know where it is going. Let your audience know exactly what you are planning to spend the funds on and how it will benefit them.

Striking a perfect balance between the visual and textual elements isn’t always easy, especially if the text is the only way to convey essential information to the audience.</p><p>Luckily, video editing and presentation software products offer the tools you will need to combine video and text. In this article, we are going to show you how to add a video to text in PowerPoint and Filmora.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Video-to-Text-for-Free-with-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Video-to-Text-for-Free-with-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to Add Video to Text for Free with PowerPoint?</h2><p>An effective PowerPoint presentation should contain proportionate amounts of textual and visual elements. Using too many images, videos or animations can make following a presentation difficult, just as too much text can render a presentation too static.</p><p>Adding videos to titles or subtitles you include in a slideshow you’re creating in PowerPoint can help you create a presentation that is both informative and visually entertaining. The process of combining videos with text in PowerPoint isn’t overly complicated, but you will still need to go through it several times in order to become familiar with it.</p><p>You should start by creating a new slide and adding a textbox to it. Proceed to type the word or phrase into the textbox and go on to format the text. Pick the font that matches the style of your presentation and make sure that the text size is large enough for the video to be visible.</p><p>Head over to the Insert tab, select Rectangle from the Shapes menu, and create a rectangular shape over the entire slide. Right-click on the slide and choose the Send to Back option from the menu. In this manner, you will position the rectangle you created behind the textbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-rectangle-shape.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Powerpoint- insert shape"                ></p><p>The next step you will have to take is to create the cut-out of the text within the rectangle. Select both the text and shape you placed in the background before clicking on the Format tab that is located near the end of PowerPoint’s ribbon.</p><p>Find the Insert Shape option and choose Subtract from the Merge Shapes drop-down menu. The shape of the text in the textbox will be applied to the object in the background, which enables you to add a video to that text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtract-from-merge-shapes.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Powerpoint- substract"                ></p><p>Click on the Insert tab, and then choose the Video option from the Media menu. You can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >insert a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is stored on a local hard drive or the Internet to PowerPoint. The video will cover the entire slide, so you must right-click on it and select the Send to Back option.</p><p>You can then fine-tune the video playback settings from the Playback tab. Preview the results before you move on to the next slide in your presentation, and make necessary adjustments if you don’t like how the video merged with the text.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Adding-Video-to-Text-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Adding-Video-to-Text-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora"></a>Part 2: Adding Video to Text in Filmora</h2><p>Besides presentation software, you can also use video editing software products to add a video to text. Filmora lets you add a video to text in just a few simple steps. You can first make a text video with animation first, and then use the picture in picture feature to add the video to text.

Click on the Titles tab, and choose the title that matches the visual style of your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-title-effects.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Filmora9"                ></p><p>Set the preferred duration of the title by dragging one of its ends to the left or right after you place it on the timeline, and then double-click on it to customize it.

When done, you should export the title as a video file, and then import it back into your project.</p><p>Now it’s time to add the text video and the background video to the project media library, and then place the two videos one above the other. Since we’re adding video to text, the text video should be placed above the background video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg"                      alt="Add video to text - Filmora9 Compositing"                ></p><p>Click on the video that contains text to gain access to the Video tab of the Editor panel and then expand the Compositing menu. Change the Blending Mode to Multiply, and the text in the overlaying video should be filled with the parts of the footage from the video below it.</p><p>Optionally you can enhance the colors in the background video or adjust the size of the text before exporting your project from Filmora.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There are so many different ways to create visually striking content, and adding videos to text is just one among numerous techniques that enable you to make a PowerPoint presentation or an opening of a video more interesting to watch.</p><p>Merging text with video is equally easy in PowerPoint and Filmora, so you just have to choose which software better suits your needs and select the materials that fit the style of your project.

There could be several reasons behind this.</p><p>That said, the following sections discuss some of the common causes of <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, and explain how you can fix the issue easily with merely a few simple mouse clicks. Here, you will also learn how to resolve the problem if it occurs on your smartphone.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-for-YouTubers-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-for-YouTubers-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor for YouTubers: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best Video Editor for YouTubers: Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Filmora is one of the most popular video editing software among YouTubers, whether you’re creating gameplay, education, travel videos, or other types of videos, you will find Filmora perfectly meets your needs.

If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.</p><p><strong>Outdated Display Driver</strong></p><p>As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]"></a>Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]</h2><p>Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong> issue may differ. Nevertheless, some of the most effective remedies are discussed below in detail:</p><h3 id="1-Web-Browser-Solution-s"><a href="#1-Web-Browser-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="1. Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC. Next, use Microsoft Edge (or any other browser) to download and install a fresh copy of Google Chrome and see if the issue is fixed</p><h3 id="2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s"><a href="#2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)"></a>2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)</h3><p>If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Get Your PC&#x2F;Laptop Closer to the Router</strong></p><p>If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network</strong></p><p>If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop&#x2F;desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.</p><p><strong>PC&#x2F;Windows Solution(s)</strong></p><p>At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:</p><p>Type <strong>CMD</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and click <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the right menu of the results list.</p><p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>User Account Control</strong> confirmation box, and in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, type <strong>IPCONFIG &#x2F;FLUSHDNS</strong> and press Enter</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="use command to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver</strong></p><p>Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card. Since a driver is needed to interact with the device, an old one might prevent the videos from getting displayed. If the graphics card is the culprit, the chances are that you won’t be able to see any video at all, be it from YouTube or offline. Therefore, checking if you are using the latest version of the graphic card driver wouldn’t harm you. The process is given below:</p><p>Right-click <strong>Start</strong> and go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu</p><p>Expand the <strong>Display adapters</strong> tree on the <strong>Device Manager</strong> snap-in, and right-click the graphics card from the list and select <strong>Update driver</strong> from the context menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upgrade-graphic-card-to-fix-youtube-video-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="upgrade graphic card to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Search automatically for drivers</strong> from the next screen that appears and follow the on-screen instructions from there to update the graphic card driver.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If your PC has multiple graphic cards installed in it, you will have to follow this procedure for each of them individually.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?"></a>Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?</h2><p>If you wish to watch online videos on your smartphone, but experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, the process of fixing the issue on the phones is comparatively simple. The steps that are given below explain the procedure:</p><h3 id="How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Android"><a href="#How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Android"></a>How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Android</h3><p><strong>Clear the Cache</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> and then tap <strong>Apps</strong> from the <strong>Settings</strong> Go to YouTube and then scroll down to Storage.</p><p>Tap it and then select <strong>Clear data and Clear cache</strong>.

In order to do so, you want to click on the File button and then go to Import. You will see a side menu on which you need to click Media and select the file that you want to upload. Keep in mind that you might have to wait for a short period of time while the videos are being uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beginner-tips-for-vegas-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="Importing Clips"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also import videos which have been published on your channel by downloading them and saving them as MP4 files.

They contain the clips you’ve used in the entire editing process. You can edit them by aligning them as you see fit in order to come up with the best sequence. You can also add additional tracks. In order to do so, all you need to do is right click on the space which is empty and then go Add video track.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Add-special-effects"><a href="#Step-3-Add-special-effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Add special effects"></a>Step 3: Add special effects</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beginner-tips-for-vegas-pro-3.jpg"                      alt="Effects"                ></p><p>Of course, what’s video editing software without powerful special effect capabilities? You will see the special effects tab located on the left side of your screen. You can easily browse throughout all of them in order to get a sense of what you can achieve with your video. There are quite a lot of different special effects that you can incorporate in your YouTube video and make it perfect.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Export"><a href="#Step-4-Export" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Export"></a>Step 4: Export</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beginner-tips-for-vegas-pro-5.jpg"                      alt="Color Match"                ></p><p>This is the thing that you need to do once you are done with the process to edit YouTube videos with Sony Vegas. It’s a very easy task to handle and if you’ve come that far you are already on the finish line. Go to File -&gt; Export and choose the specific extension that you want to use.

This will only happen after being accepted to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). The program enables revenue sharing from ads and gives creators access to more features and resources like the Copyright Match Tool.</p><p>Anyone residing in countries where the YPP program is available can apply, To get accepted, you will need to meet the following requirements</p><ul><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 4,000+ public watch in the past 365 days, or</li><li>1,000 + Subscribers and 10M+ public watch in the past 90 days</li></ul><h3 id="Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid"><a href="#Which-YouTube-Views-are-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Which YouTube Views are Paid"></a><strong>Which YouTube Views are Paid</strong></h3><p>The ad revenue generated from the program is split between different parties. Specifically, Google pays out $68 for every $100 an advertiser pays to the publisher. However, YouTube earns only when viewers skip the ad before 30 seconds, which means you will not be paid. With only an estimated 15% of the viewers watching the required 30 seconds of a video to qualify for payment, not every view will result in being paid. Only the YouTube monetization per view gets paid.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money-2.JPG"                      alt="percentage of views paid"                ></p><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-the-Number-of-Views-Needed-to-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money"></a><strong>Factors Affecting the Number of Views Needed to Make Money</strong></h3><p>To make good money on YouTube, however, you’ll want to cross the 100,000 views per video mark. This may sound easy, but getting the accurate amount earned is more than just these simple numbers. Several factors are involved:</p><ul><li>Your youtube niche</li><li>The level of viewers’ satisfaction</li><li>The value of your views or presentation’</li><li>The rate of engagement in your videos</li></ul><p>The main factor that determines how many views for YouTube monetization you need to make money is niche. For instance, a channel in the Finance and Technology niche will make more money per 1000 views than those affiliated with comedy or gaming. This is because YouTube channels are monetized by Google Adsense, which pays more for more profitable niches.</p><p>On average, you can earn between $1 to more than $25 per 1,000 monetized views on YouTube. This comes down to the specific content you are making and the niche of focus. Those in niches like Finance and Tech will make more money because the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) is higher than other niches. In terms of engagement, videos with higher click-through rates (CTR) and average view duration (AVD) tend to earn more from ads. Other factors such as the country where your viewers are located, time of the year, and type of ads you are running also affect the money earned.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View"><a href="#Part-2-Factors-That-Affect-Your-YouTube-Earnings-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View"></a><strong>Part 2. Factors That Affect Your YouTube Earnings Per View</strong></h2><p>The amount of money that YouTubers make may seem complex to understand. Does YouTube pay per view? Yes, but not per video view. YouTube will pay you for views that appear on your channels. The actual revenue will depend on several factors.</p><ul><li><a href="#factor1">Factors Affecting Earnings per View</a></li><li><a href="#factor2">YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</a></li><li><a href="#factor3">Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</a></li><li><a href="#factor4">Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</a></li></ul><h3 id="Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View"><a href="#Factors-Affecting-Earnings-per-View" class="headerlink" title="Factors Affecting Earnings per View"></a><strong>Factors Affecting Earnings per View</strong></h3><p>The amount of money YouTubers make per view is affected by various factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ad Revenue Rates</strong>: The rates vary depending on the country where viewers are located, the time of the year, and the ad your YouTube channel is running.</li><li><strong>Audience Demographics</strong>: Advertisers usually pay more to show their ads to viewers in some demographics, especially those who are interested in specific products or have a high income.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement</strong>: Videos with high CTR and AVD earn more income from ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time</strong>: YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time earn more money.</li></ul><h3 id="YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model"><a href="#YouTube’s-Revenue-Sharing-Model" class="headerlink" title="YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model"></a><strong>YouTube’s Revenue-Sharing Model</strong></h3><p>The YouTibe’s revenue-sharing model determines how much creators are paid. The standard revenue share is 55% for the creator and 45% for YouTube based on views that generate money. However, the platform may adjust the revenue share for certain creators. This may include creators participating in a special program or those who are part of a network.</p><p>An Ad blocker can reduce a YouTuber’s earnings. They prevent ads from displaying on videos, and consequently the creator from earning money that you have generated from those ads. As they become more popular, YouTube estimates that ad blockers cost creators billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p><h3 id="Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers"><a href="#Attracting-Higher-Paying-Advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers"></a><strong>Attracting Higher-Paying Advertisers</strong></h3><p>Higher-paying advertisers are interested in YouTube channels that align with these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Audience Demographics:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are interested in videos that show certain demographics. For example, an advertiser of a luxury car will pay more to show ads to viewers who are interested in such cars.</li><li><strong>Audience Engagement:</strong> Higher-paying advertisers are willing to pay more to show their ads to channels with higher engagement to increase the chances of people clicking on their ads.</li><li><strong>Watch Time:</strong> YouTube channels with longer viewers watch time attract more advertisers. This is because viewers will be engaged for longer periods, increasing their chances of viewing the ad.</li></ul><h3 id="Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube"><a href="#Other-Revenue-Streams-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Other Revenue Streams on YouTube"></a><strong>Other Revenue Streams on YouTube</strong></h3><p>You can earn a lot more per 1,000 views by influencing your viewers to buy products even before your channel gets monetized. Other ways of making money on YouTube include</p><ul><li>Selling branded merch or courses</li><li>YouTube Premium subscriber’s subscription fee</li><li>Recurring monthly payments by members for special benefits</li><li>Highlight fan’s messages in chat streams</li><li>Sponsorships by partnering with brands to promote their products or services</li><li>Affiliate marketing</li><li>Brand deals</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Editing-YouTube-Videos-for-YouTube-Monetization-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. **Editing YouTube Videos for YouTube Monetization with Filmora"></a><strong>Part 3.</strong> **Editing YouTube Videos for YouTube Monetization with Filmora</h2><p>Good content will increase audience engagement and grow your YouTube channel.

Cards are more graphical whereas annotations are text based. The cards slide in once you click the small “i” button on the video where as the annotation is there based on the timings set by the user. Moreover the main differences between the two are:</p><p>1. YouTube Cards are small and unobtrusive, unless a viewer chooses to click on them, which is why they are the better option when you are trying to get views on other videos. Irritating a few people with a big annotation might be worth it if you also draw other people’s attention to your cause or website, but it is not a good way to endear yourself to people you are trying to get views and subscriptions from. When a card is clicked a thumbnail will appear with a link to your additional content. YouTube Cards are often better than annotations for adding links to your videos because they look much tidier. Also, unlike annotations, cards will be visible to people watching your videos on their mobile devices.</p><p>2. You cannot use Cards just to insert notes into your videos, though, and you cannot adjust their size like you can with annotations. So, if you do need a link to be large and extremely noticeable, annotations might still be your best option. Cards and annotations can even be used in combination sometimes.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Add YouTube Cards</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add YouTube Annotations</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-add-YouTube-Cards"><a href="#How-to-add-YouTube-Cards" class="headerlink" title="How to add YouTube Cards"></a>How to add YouTube Cards</h2><p>YouTube <strong>Cards</strong> are similar to annotations but more interactive. They allow the owner of the video to add images and other links. A small box appears, clicking on which will activate the cards.</p><ul><li>Click on the “Video Manager” tab</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-manager-in-youtube.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li>Click “Edit” tab under the video screen shot you want to add the card on</li><li>Click on the “Cards” tab</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-cards01.png"                                     ></p><ul><li>On the right panel click on “Add Card” drop down menu and select the type of card you want to add</li><li>Click on the create button which will open the corresponding video</li><li>Once you finish the subsequent information required click create card</li><li>Select the timeline for the playhead to appear which leads to the card slide</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-cards-to-youtube-video.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li>Apply changes and exit</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-add-YouTube-annotations"><a href="#How-to-add-YouTube-annotations" class="headerlink" title="How to add YouTube annotations"></a>How to add YouTube annotations</h2><p>YouTube Annotation is addition of a text layer, link or hotspots over your video.

Speech Bubbles"></a>1. Speech Bubbles</h4><p>Speech Bubbles: look like the dialogue box in a comic strip. There is a tail which you can adjust so it looks like one of the people in your video is saying what is written in the annotation. Speech bubbles are great for adding in funny comments.</p><h4 id="2-Notes"><a href="#2-Notes" class="headerlink" title="2. Notes"></a>2. Notes</h4><p>Notes: come in a limited selection of colors and can be adjusted to take up a maximum of 30% of your player screen. Sometimes you need a huge annotation to get an important point across, but using huge note annotations too often – especially near the beginnings of your videos – will annoy viewers. If you need a large note annotation make sure to place it later in your video, when a viewer will already be invested in what they are watching and less likely to click away.</p><h4 id="3-Titles"><a href="#3-Titles" class="headerlink" title="3. Titles"></a>3. Titles</h4><p>Titles: are large pieces of text that go either at the beginning of your video or in-between different topics within your video. YouTube’s titles are not very nice to look at, but they are a decent option if you do not have access to video editing software.</p><h4 id="4-Spotlights"><a href="#4-Spotlights" class="headerlink" title="4. Spotlights"></a>4. Spotlights</h4><p>Spotlights: have a subtle border and are completely clear inside. Your text only appears when a user hovers over the spotlight. Spotlights are great for turning elements within your video into links.</p><h4 id="5-Labels"><a href="#5-Labels" class="headerlink" title="5. Labels"></a>5. Labels</h4><p>Labels: are completely transparent, like spotlights, but the user does not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.</p><h4 id="6-Pauses"><a href="#6-Pauses" class="headerlink" title="6. Pauses"></a>6. Pauses</h4><p>Pauses: are no longer available to add to your videos, although Pause Annotations added before they were removed still work. Pause Annotations used to stop your video for a set period of time when your annotation appeared.</p><p>If somebody watches your video and gets to the end then that means they enjoyed it and will probably be open to checking out more of your content. Rather than hoping that your other videos show up in the ‘Suggested Videos’ YouTube will show after yours has finished playing you should always include an outro, or ending card, after your video to recommend your own work. Annotations are used in a lot of successful YouTuber’s ending cards.</p><p>One form this takes is small Note annotations in the bottom corners of the screen, one linking to your previous video and one to the next. Sometimes your viewers might not necessarily get the most enjoyment out of your videos by watching them in order, though. Sometimes you want to link viewers to the videos that are most related to the one they just watched.</p><p>The best outros also include a subscribe button, which can be created using annotations. These annotations work best when combined with a verbal call to action. Make sure your outro lasts long enough for people to make the decision to subscribe or click another video.</p><p>No matter what kind of annotations you are using, you should never use more than two of them at a time anywhere except for your outro. You should also never place annotations at the very top of your screen, or in the middle at the bottom. If your video is embedding on a separate website then the player will cover annotations at the top of the screen, and ads might cover annotations placed in the bottom-middle of the screen. Keep in mind when using annotations that they will not be visible to users watching your videos on mobile devices. If mobile traffic is very important to you then consider using YouTube Cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/egies-for-elevating-your-content-with-featured-channels-on-youtube/"><u>Strategies for Elevating Your Content with Featured Channels on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-maximizing-income-with-youtube-adsense/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Maximizing Income with YouTube AdSense</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/y-transformation-from-pixels-to-polished-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>Speedy Transformation  From Pixels to Polished YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-maximize-your-earnings-with-youtube-short-tips/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Maximize Your Earnings with Youtube Short Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-eluding-youtube-ban-protective-measures/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Eluding YouTube Ban  Protective Measures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-boosting-earnings-in-the-quick-flicks-of-youtube-shorts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Boosting Earnings in the Quick Flicks of YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/est-free-video-translation-youtubes-extractors-and-downloader-list/"><u>The Best-Free Video Translation  YouTube's Extractors & Downloader List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/-your-potential-income-from-youtube-sponsored-videos-for-2024/"><u>What's Your Potential Income From YouTube Sponsored Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-penny-pinching-picks-microphones-under-50-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Penny-Pinching Picks  Microphones Under $50 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-from-novice-to-pro-simplified-youtube-live-streaming-with-obs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Novice to Pro  Simplified YouTube Live Streaming with OBS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/audiences-choice-prime-action-recorder-for-2024/"><u>Audience's Choice  Prime Action Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/undelete-lost-contacts-from-vivo-y78-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>Undelete lost contacts from Vivo Y78 5G.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-harnessing-the-power-of-visual-education-techniques/"><u>[Updated] Harnessing the Power of Visual Education Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/solving-steam-service-problems-for-a-smooth-windows-11-experience/"><u>Solving Steam Service Problems for a Smooth Windows 11 Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-motorola-edgeplus-2023-find-my-friends-no-location-found-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fix Motorola Edge+ (2023) Find My Friends No Location Found? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-logging-live-video-conversations/"><u>2024 Approved  Logging Live Video Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-tiktok-aspect-ratios-a-step-by-step-guide-for-2024/"><u>Updated Mastering TikTok Aspect Ratios A Step-by-Step Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-the-power-of-scheduled-instagram-posts/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking the Power of Scheduled Instagram Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-fast-forward-to-fun-10-best-free-video-speed-changing-apps-for-ios-and-android/"><u>Updated In 2024, Fast Forward to Fun 10 Best Free Video Speed Changing Apps for iOS and Android</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The good news is that time spent on YouTube is on the rise around the world. There’s no reason you can’t have a slice of that gigantic pie.</p><p>When it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html" >running a successful YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it’s all about subscribers. The more subscribers you attract, the more your videos will be viewed and shared online. In fact, YouTube confirms that subscribers watch double the number of videos non-subscribers do. So, getting more people to subscribe to your channel will certainly increase the number of views and engagement your videos get.</p><p>It’s no wonder the rate at which channels’ subscribers grow is an important metric in YouTube’s algorithm. The channels with the best rate of subscriber growth get featured. It’s not about suddenly skyrocketing to stardom, though. It’s about consistent growth. So, as a YouTube creator, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html" >growing your subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should definitely be a top priority.</p><p>There are many tips out there on how to go about <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-top-10-smartest-ways-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-311.html" >increasing your YouTube subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this post, we share 4 simple and smart tricks to get the process rolling.</p><ol><li><a href="#links"><strong>Make Sure All Your Links Are Subscribe Links</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="#sort">Sort Your Videos Into Playlists</a></strong></li><li><a href="#trailer"><strong>Create a Channel Trailer or Set a Featured Video</strong></a></li><li><a href="#rivals"><strong>Add Your Rivals To Your Tags</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS"><a href="#1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS" class="headerlink" title="1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS"></a><strong>1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS</strong></h2><p>This point is key. By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe. Subscribe links create a pop-up once viewers reach your channel. It’s a bold move that can give you instant results especially if you are referring traffic to your YouTube channel from other social media platforms.</p><p>All you need do is add ‘_?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1_’ at the end of all your YouTube links and there’ll be a pop-up whenever people click.</p><p>Now, it’s true that YouTube’s subscribe button isn’t exactly hidden. The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage. However, including your own subscribe link (via a YouTube card or in your video’s description) allows you to write a message that creates a sense of urgency which can produce fast results especially when people are really interested in watching your videos.</p><h2 id="2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS"><a href="#2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS" class="headerlink" title="2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS"></a><strong>2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS</strong></h2><p>Playlists have long been a part of our entertainment experience. Whether on our iPods or via apps like SoundCloud or Spotify, playlists make it easy for us to find and access the kind of content we like. But playlists aren’t just for music. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Creating playlists on your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a very smart move. It gives your subscribers and viewers added value they will appreciate. Part of the hassle of being online these days is trying to find the content you actually want to consume because you have to wade through so much content you aren’t actually interested in. By taking the work out of finding related content, you actually increase the chances that your viewers will stay longer on your channel and watch more of your videos.</p><p>You can also create playlists to curate content by other YouTube creators. As long as your curated content falls within your chosen category, and also complements your channel, you should go for it. In a way, creating curated playlists makes it easier to convince non-subscribed viewers that you understand the sort of content they like, and your channel is one to watch. Seeing that you know the best content and creators for a particular topic might just be the thing that convinces non-subscribed viewers to sign-on to receive updates from your channel.</p><h2 id="3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO"><a href="#3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO" class="headerlink" title="3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO"></a><strong>3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO</strong></h2><p>Most dedicated YouTube creators have made <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s their chance to give visitors a taste of what they’re all about in a short and exciting video. YouTube trailers are a sure way to hook viewers and you should definitely make one if you want to increase your channel subscribers fast.</p><p>YouTube channel trailers are usually under a minute long. In less than 60 seconds, you can showcase your best videos and get viewers excited about what you have to offer. You may choose to employ the sorts of clever videography we see in movie trailers. With so many open source and free video editing programs, doing this is actually not as difficult as you might think. The bottom line is that a YouTube trailer can be a creative and effective way of creating buzz about your channel and ultimately, growing your subscribers.</p><p>That said, you don’t have to make a YouTube channel trailer if you don’t want to. Setting a featured video can be just as effective. Featuring your most popular video will make a b first impression on people who visit your channel and increase the likelihood that they’ll click the subscribe button. Featuring your most recent video will keep your channel looking fresh.</p><h2 id="4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS"><a href="#4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS" class="headerlink" title="4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS"></a><strong>4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS</strong></h2><p>Adding your rival’s names to your tags might sound a bit underhanded, but it’s a fair way of increasing the chances that your content will show up as related to theirs. The trick is to choose rivals whose content ranks highest for the category or group related to your own content.</p><p>To find your rivals, simply search for your video titles. If your video is very popular and you’ve optimized it well enough, it may rank tops in your search. In most cases, however, the search results will show someone else’s content at the top of the list. Adding the names of the top 3 creators on that search list to your video’s tags will increase the likelihood that your video will be presented to viewers as related to theirs. When your video shows up as related to a top-ranking video, the chance that it will be viewed is increased significantly.

With multiple features and a design that has been made for streamers like you, you’ll always be able to just turn it on, make adjustments with ease, and get streaming in no time.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The camera is incredibly easy to use and install; it connects to your PC with a USB type C to USB type 3.0 cord (backwards compatible to 2.0). You can easily tinker with all of the settings and such in the included software.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The arm is designed for thick edges; those with flat monitors or borderless monitors may find that it’s difficult to attach it to your monitor. The software is easy to use, but it’s missing a handful of settings that more experienced streamers would want to have available. There is a crop out background feature, but it can be hard to find and use.</p><h3 id="4-PANASONIC-Lumix-G7-4K-Digital-Camera"><a href="#4-PANASONIC-Lumix-G7-4K-Digital-Camera" class="headerlink" title="4.

All of the controls make it easy to get things the way that you want it, and it comes with multiple ports so that you can plug it into any device and get it ready to go.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> This one of the best 4k video options out there, and you don’t need to spend an arm and a leg on it. The dual control dials and the variable touch LCD allow for maximum control, making it simple to film what you want with minimal editing after you’ve filmed.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> There is a tracking focus, which can be good, but it makes the burst rate (which helps with motion blur) a lot slower. It does have a plastic build, rather than metal, so it’s not as heavy duty as other options. And, you need to purchase it with everything included, instead of just purchasing the body.</p><h3 id="5-Sony-CX405-Full-HD"><a href="#5-Sony-CX405-Full-HD" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s the starter camera that beginners dream of due to its ease of use and affordability.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The image stabilization is some of the best out there, and it’s got a user friendly interface. Dual recording options make for great YouTube and other social media use. Lightweight makes it easy to take anywhere.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Connectivity ports are in strange spots, and can be hard to get to. You cannot add an external mic, so you have to use the on-board ones.

This is an option if you need freedom in your movement.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The DJI OSMO Handheld Gimbal is really easy to use and compatible with most mobile phones that are out there. With multiple settings and options, you can easily turn your phone into the very best option for getting footage, even if your regular video camera isn’t nearby.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some people note that it doesn’t work with wide-screen mobile devices or “phablets” as they are called. Another complaint is that it can be difficult to get used the construction of the Gimbal, but that’s something that you can sort out with practice.</p><h3 id="7-Canon-Digital-SLR-Camera-Kit"><a href="#7-Canon-Digital-SLR-Camera-Kit" class="headerlink" title="7.

Businesses use FameBit to find the perfect video creators – or ‘digital influencers’ – to help with their marketing campaigns.</p><p>Until your channel is huge it is difficult to make a significant amount of money through ad revenue on YouTube. Creating branded content is one way in which YouTubers with small or mid-sized channels can generate income.</p><p>Finding sponsorships and negotiating with brands can be tricky. So can integrating products and brand messages in your videos without making your audience feel like you have ‘sold out’. This guide will help.</p><p>You must have at least 5,000 subscribers to join FameBit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-famebit-find-youtube-sponsorship.jpg"                      alt="Use FameBit to Find YouTube Sponsorship"                ></p><h2 id="How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Can You Make"></a>How Much Money Can You Make</h2><p>How much money you can make on FameBit will depend on the deals you can negotiate with brands, and those deals will depend on how many subscribers you have and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how many views you usually receive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>When calculating your fee, FameBit suggests thinking of it in terms of ‘cost per view’ (CPV). Most creators on FameBit charge between $0.05 and $0.10 per view. If you charge $0.05 per view and you get an average of 10,000 views per video then you would charge a brand $500 for your services.</p><p>How much you should charge per view depends on your genre and the nature of your audience. If you often mention products you like in videos and your subscribers have come to trust your recommendations, then it makes sense for you to charge more per view than a creator whose audience will be less receptive to product placement.</p><p>For example, if you do makeup tutorials then viewers will be used to hearing about your favorites. This makes your 10 000 views more valuable than 10 000 views on a ranting vlog channel whose subscribers are not tuning in to hear about products.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit"><a href="#How-to-Make-Money-With-FameBit" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Money With FameBit"></a>How to Make Money With FameBit</h2><h4 id="Finding-Sponsorships"><a href="#Finding-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="Finding Sponsorships"></a>Finding Sponsorships</h4><p>Brands post details about their upcoming campaigns, and the types of creators they are interested in working with, on FameBit.</p><p>While you are browsing through the available campaigns, think of the types of brands you would be excited to work with as well as which ones make sense for your channel.</p><p>If you host a lifestyle vlog about staying healthy, for example, and there is an opportunity to work with a brand that sells a type of healthy snack then it is your responsibility to look into the company and the product before you sign on to work with them. Is the snack healthy, and do you enjoy it?</p><p>Ideally, you will want to find brands that share your values and which are selling products you feel good about recommending to your subscribers.</p><p>Once you find a few campaigns you are interested in creating videos for, it’s time to write your proposals and negotiate with your potential sponsors.</p><h4 id="Negotiating-with-Sponsors"><a href="#Negotiating-with-Sponsors" class="headerlink" title="Negotiating with Sponsors"></a>Negotiating with Sponsors</h4><p>When you want to be part of a campaign a brand has posted, you send them a proposal.</p><p>Be creative and detailed in the proposals you write. The best brands will value you for our ideas and creativity, and this will give you an edge over creators who put less effort into their pitches. You also want to be detailed because you do not want to risk having a disagreement with the brand based on them misunderstanding what you were going to do.</p><p>Sometimes brands will have very specific things they want you to do or say in the video you make for them. It is your job to find ways of doing and saying these things that still feel natural within the context of your videos. On YouTube, even when you are representing a brand, you need to be authentically you.</p><p>If you feel like the things a brand wants from you will make your video come across as a tacky commercial and offend your loyal subscribers, and you cannot see a creative way around this, bring it up before you agree to work with them. Explain what you think should happen instead. If they are not willing to compromise, do not agree to work with them. Find a more reasonable brand to partner with.</p><p>If you offend your subscribers and they stop watching you then your channel will become less valuable to other potential sponsors. In the long run, there is no upside to agreeing to do a video that makes no sense for your channel.</p><p>Remember that even brands that like your ideas and get excited about your proposals will not be able to work with you if you do not meet their requirements in terms of subscribers and average views. There are a lot of campaigns on FameBit which are open to small or mid-sized channels, but there will always be minimum requirements. It makes no sense for a brand to pay you to make a video nobody will see, even if it is an amazing video. Sad, but true.</p><h4 id="How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Alienating-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience"></a>How to Avoid Alienating Your Audience</h4><p>Some of your subscribers will resent any branded content you create and there is no way around that. These subscribers will be in the minority – most people understand that accepting sponsorship from brands helps their favorite YouTubers continue making great videos – but it is unavoidable that there will be a few.</p><p>Most of your subscribers will not be bothered by the idea of you partnering with a brand, so long as you go about it in the right way.</p><p>Firstly; be honest about your sponsorship. Do not pretend to be giving an objective opinion on a product when the company who makes it is paying you. Your viewers will know and they will be offended.</p><p>Secondly; incorporate the brand’s message or product into your videos in ways that feel natural. Do not stray too far from your usual video style. Ultimately every video you make, even branded content, is for your viewers. Make the kind of video they expect from you and mention the product or service you have agreed to in a place where it makes sense&#x2F;is on topic.</p><p>You want the branding in your videos to be

Viewers are more likely to click your cards if there are fewer of them, and more likely to start ignoring them if it seems like they’re always popping up. Also, do not have all three of these cards appear at once and make people choose between them. Stagger them throughout your video.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Your cards should be related to what you are saying in your vlog. Avoid posting completely random links in the middle of your video because a viewer who clicks on them will get confused. You can post any type of link you want at the very end of your video, though.</p><p> <strong>4.</strong> The end of your video is always a great place to link viewers to another of your videos, whether you use a card or an end screen. If somebody liked your video enough to watch until the end they’ll probably welcome a chance to consume similar content.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now, that you are aware how to add YouTube end screen to your video, make use of the amazing features of YouTube end screen and cards and let driving in traffic to your site be easy and fruitful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-conquer-youtube-searches-with-these-top-11-seo-strategies/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Conquer YouTube Searches with These Top 11 SEO Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/p-by-step-guide-for-earning-with-youtube-shorts/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide for Earning with YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/imate-live-streaming-apps-for-iphone-and-android-users-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>7 Ultimate Live Streaming Apps for iPhone and Android Users on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/el-creation-made-simple-youtubes-top-business-channels-listed/"><u>Channel Creation Made Simple  YouTube's Top Business Channels Listed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-unlock-channels-success-key-equipment-insights/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlock Channels Success  Key Equipment Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-disable-non-specific-youtube-video-alerts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Disable Non-Specific YouTube Video Alerts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-avoid-these-8-steps-that-newcomers-often-miss-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, Avoid These 8 Steps that Newcomers Often Miss on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-proficient-content-tagging-made-simple-the-best-7-budget-friendly-online-taggification-apps-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] Proficient Content Tagging Made Simple  The Best 7 Budget-Friendly Online Taggification Apps Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-guide-to-choosing-among-top-recorders/"><u>[New] Essential Guide to Choosing Among Top Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/apply-these-techniques-to-improve-how-to-detect-fake-gps-location-on-honor-x50i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Apply These Techniques to Improve How to Detect Fake GPS Location On Honor X50i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-inside-out-stardew-valley-and-the-allure-of-ginger-island/"><u>In 2024, Inside Out  Stardew Valley and the Allure of Ginger Island</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-video-creation-adobe-captivate-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Mastering Video Creation  Adobe Captivate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-to-blackberry-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data from Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro to BlackBerry | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/in-2024-learn-everything-about-leeming-lut-pro/"><u>In 2024, Learn Everything About Leeming LUT Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-oppo-a56s-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Oppo A56s 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/2024-approved-melodic-merger-evaluating-premier-online-and-traditional-offline-mp3-converters-for-karaoke-use/"><u>2024 Approved Melodic Merger Evaluating Premier Online and Traditional Offline MP3 Converters for Karaoke Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-bite-sized-video-specialist/"><u>[New] In 2024, Bite-Sized Video Specialist</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You can add simple texts and captions to videos with the free video editing software. To add more text effects to the video, you can use Filmora, Sony Vegas Movie Studio and Adobe Premiere CC based on your video editing skills and needs. These software programs are great video editors, which can help you input text easily.</p><h4 id="1-Use-Filmora"><a href="#1-Use-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.  Use Filmora"></a>1.  Use Filmora</h4><p>There are plenty of Text effects built in Filmora, you can apply motions and animation to texts, titles, subtitles, end credits and openers as well. Each title preset will present different effects. You can add multiple text boxes and place the text to any position in need. Besides writing texts to video, you can select the target font, size and color and customize the text effect in detail as well. To add text to a video in Filmora is easy, just follow the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-advanced-text-edit-interface.jpg"                      alt="Add Text to Video"                ></p><ul><li>Open up Filmora and drag a clip into your timeline. Then, go to   <strong>Text&#x2F;Credit.</strong></li><li>Find a style that you like and drag it into your timeline where you want your text to appear. Make sure your text is selected in your timeline and click the   <strong>Advanced Text Editing</strong> icon, which looks like a pen and paper.</li><li>Insert your own words and drag your text to where you want it on the screen. Adjust the size by dragging the blue squares which surround your text.</li><li>To change the color of your text, go into the <strong>Customize</strong>  menu. You will find it near the top left of your screen. While you are in <strong>Customize</strong> there will be a section called <strong>Fill</strong>. This is where you select the color of your text.

If it does, you will see something like Published: English (Automatic) to the right of your video. If the automatically generated subtitles is not correct, you can edit it to improve the accuracy. Select the line that needs modification to make the edits.</p><p>If there is no auto-subtitles, you can choose from 3 ways to add subtitles and closed captions to the video: Upload a file, Transcribe and auto-sync and create new subtitles or CC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-ways-to-add-youtube-subtitles.jpg"                      alt="Add Text to Video"                ></p><p><strong>Upload a file:</strong> upload a text transcript or timed subtitles file.</p><p><strong>Transcribe and auto-sync:</strong> Type or paste in a full transcript of the video and subtitle timings will be set automatically.</p><p><strong>Create new subtitles or CC:</strong> Create subtitles and closed captions by typing them in as you watch the video.</p><p>If you already have a caption file which contains both text and time codes, just click <strong>Upload</strong> a file and upload the text to the video.</p><ul><li>Once everything is okay, you can change the name of the video and you can do it in the box beside Project.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Using YouTube Video Editor</strong></p><p>When you make use of this editor, you cannot shorten the clips for music.

Leave Room"></a>1. Leave Room</h4><p>If you know you are going to add text to your video then make sure you leave room for it in your frame. Consider standing off to one side instead of directly in front of your camera. You do not want to have to choose between not using text, making your text really small, or placing it over your face.</p><p>While planning out your frame and leaving room for your text, consider what color you are going to make the words and whether it will stand out and look good against your background.</p><h4 id="2-Bigger-is-Better"><a href="#2-Bigger-is-Better" class="headerlink" title="2. Bigger is Better"></a>2. Bigger is Better</h4><p>People should be able to read your text without putting in any extra effort, such as straining their eyes to make out small words. If it takes effort to read your text then a lot of people will just ignore it. Your text should be big enough that somebody watching your video on their smartphone screen – where everything is shrunk down – can read it easily.</p><p>It is easier to make your text larger when you stick to titles, keywords, and short sentences.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Not-Overuse"><a href="#3-Do-Not-Overuse" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Not Overuse"></a>3. Do Not Overuse</h4><p>Text is a great tool for making something stand out. However, if you try to use text to emphasize too much of what you say it will lose its effect. Text does not stand out anymore once viewers get too used to seeing it. Too much text can even get annoying and cause people to click away from your videos.</p><p>Try to use text to emphasize only the most important things you say.</p><p><a

Seeing the success of Instagram Reels and TikTok, it seems like YouTube didn’t want to lag behind the game. So in September last year, it decided to step into short-form content via YouTube Shorts, a social platform for quick 60-second videos hosted on the YouTube app.</p><p>According to the Shorts product lead <strong>Todd Sherman</strong>, the social media giant aims to unleash new grounds for creativity.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok is a short-form, video-sharing app that assists users to share and make 15-second to 60-seconds videos on any topic.</p><p>TikTok contains a separate app for the Chinese market, <strong>Douyin</strong>, with 300 million-plus active monthly users. The new app’s logo is a merger of the Duyin and Musical.ly logos.</p><p>And, we’re going to discuss the comparison of both these giants, i.e., <strong>YouTube</strong> <strong>Shorts vs. TikTok</strong>, in terms of which app is better for making short videos.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?"></a>Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?</h2><p>In general, we can’t say that YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok because YouTube Shorts is YouTube’s expansion and have its own identity than TikTok.</p><p>YouTube Shorts is playing hand in hand with TikTok as the short-form video platform, but the Shorts integration with the broader ecosystem of YouTube is its key selling point according to Google’s service.</p><p>Ironically, while YouTube is laying ways to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. This is why TikTok has tripled its maximum video length to three minutes for everyone and has been developing apps slowly on TV platforms like Fire TV and Android TV.</p><p>At a glance, YouTube Shorts looks pretty similar to TikTok. However, there are certain TikTok features that even the Shorts product manager Todd Sherman disagrees with is that of the YouTube Shorts. Sherman said the way TikTok works is quite an industry-wide standard than the point of view of any single app.</p><p>Even though YouTube is quite late to the short-form content game, it has a strong brand of YouTube behind it.</p><p>Thus, saying that “YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok” doesn’t even qualify in terms of the $100 million fund sanctioned for the creators of YouTube Shorts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?"></a>Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?</h2><p>In this section, we’ve defined the analysis of <strong>YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok</strong> in the form of both a comparison table and specific points of similarities and differences.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Basis of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong></th><th><strong>TikTok</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Video Length&#x2F;Duration</strong></td><td>Up to 60 seconds</td><td>Up to 3 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>9:16</td><td>9:16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video Captions&#x2F;Description</strong></td><td>You can find the video title in the exact location as the TikTok caption, but the description is visible only after users click on the three dots.</td><td>Video captions are located at the bottom left.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Placement of Analytics</strong></td><td>YouTube Studio</td><td>TikTok app itself</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dislike Button</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok"><a href="#Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Section 1.

Thus, even though it keeps up the promise of creating, watching, and sharing both long and short-form content, it may turn away those who prefer focused access to quick content. Regardless, with YouTube Shorts now starting to become available to more users, the battle in the viral video market with TikTok is sure to heat up.</p><p>Before giving you our opinion on which is the better platform for short video promotion, go through the following conversation first.</p><p>Ramona Pringle is an associate professor and a tech expert at Toronto’s Ryerson University. She said in an interview that because YouTube already has figured out video content, the transformation to add short-form video will be natural.</p><p>She also mentioned that YouTube Shorts is the platform best placed with the competition from TikTok than all other platforms. However, YouTube doesn’t need to be TikTok as it has its strategies and broad audience base.</p><p>Like Pringle, Matt Navarra, a social media consultant based in the U.K., said in an interview that Shorts is a logical evolution and extension of YouTube, which has further given rise to TikTok. But unlike TikTok, Shorts has a few features that it can take benefit from. Among these features is the extensive audio library content, the greater scope for users to remix and create duets and stuff from scratch. Undoubtedly, you can’t deny the experience of YouTube in terms of access to partnerships with the music industry and licensing.</p><p>Thus, keeping all these factors in mind, we’d like to conclude that both the YouTube Shorts and TikTok are great and considerable platforms for short video promotion. Still, we’d like to place YouTube Shorts in the upper place due to its global availability. Whereas TikTok is already banned in certain countries.</p><p>It also depends upon the audience base of the country as to which platform is in use the most. Suppose it’s TikTok that people primarily use in a particular country or location where the brand wants to advertise itself. In that case, going with TikTok for short video promotion is better and vice versa.</p><p>To get more information, click the following video!</p><h3 id="TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice"><a href="#TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice" class="headerlink" title="TikTok or YouTube?

<strong>YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok</strong>.</p><p>Since YouTube wants its new platform to progress and stand a chance in front of TikTok, they will make Shorts a priority, and thus much more likely to promote it to a broad audience.</p><p>As we step further into the year, it is yet to consider which short-form video platform will be popular among the creators, marketers, and consumers.</p><p><img
