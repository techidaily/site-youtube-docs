This method requires basic CSS, HTML, or Java knowledge; otherwise, you won’t be able to customize your playlist.</p><p>Moreover, this method is too complicated for beginners, and you will miss the customer support provided by WordPress plugin developers in case of any mishaps.</p><p>To use the oEmbed Code method, do the following steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, head to your YouTube account and access the Playlist you want to embed. Next, click the three dots below it and copy its URL.</p><p>Step2 Now, login to your WordPress dashboard and open the post or page editor where you want to add the playlist.</p><p>Step3 Paste the URL directly in the editor and click <strong>“Update”</strong> to save the changes.</p><p>WordPress will grab your playlist from YouTube and automatically show it in your post using oEmbed. The outcome is a single video with a menu that your viewers can click to see other videos in the playlist.</p><h3 id="Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-WebsiteUsing"><a href="#Embedding-a-YouTube-Playlist-on-WebsiteUsing" class="headerlink" title="Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing "></a>Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing <iframe ></h3><p>Another way to embed a playlist of your YouTube channel on your WordPress site is by using the iFrame code with the following step-by-step instructions:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch a browser on your desktop or laptop and go to your <strong>YouTube channel.</strong></p><p>Step2 Now, head to the YouTube playlist you want to embed, click the <strong>“Share”</strong> icon, and a pop-up window will appear.</p><p>Step3 Choose the <strong>“Embed”</strong> option, and a new lightbox pop-up will appear, having your playlist’s embed code.

Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. SpinXO</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2. Name Generator"></a>2. Name Generator</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can be hilarious</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Names tend to be a bit long</p><p>This is a fairly limited generator. You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3. Username Generator"></a>3. Username Generator</h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can generate a huge number of names at once</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  You only input one word</p><p>For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator"                ></p><p>The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it. Some endings are words, and some are just suffixes.

You may want to use one of the name generators above (anchor) for this part.</p><p>Try to keep your name fairly short (3 words or less) so it’s easier for people to remember. Don’t include numbers if you can avoid it.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Say-it-out-loud"><a href="#Step-3-Say-it-out-loud" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Say it out loud"></a><strong>Step 3: Say it out loud</strong></h4><p>Once you have a shortlist of potential names, read them aloud to yourself to make sure they sound good.

Master Copy"></a>1. Master Copy</h4><p> Before exporting your work, it is important to first create a master copy of your project that is ‘as is’, in that it reflects the settings and codecs used in the original footage.</p><p> To do this you simply select the sequence within the Timeline or in the Project Panel, and go through the menu tree via <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> to bring up the export dialogue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/exportdialogue.png"                      alt="exportdialogue"                ></p><p> To create your Master Copy, simply select the first option of ‘Match Sequence Settings’, this exports a file that is of the same quality as your original footage, essentially producing a digital copy of the work for archiving before anything else is done.</p><p> With you work safe and secure it is now time to look at ensuring the project is suitable for YouTube. With our sequence selected in the Timeline or Project Panel again, we go through the same <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> path to bring up the media export dialogue as before.</p><h4 id="2-Container"><a href="#2-Container" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p> The first option we have to consider is the file format that our finished video needs to be in. Here you should refer to YouTube for its guidelines, whilst they do accept a number of file formats, digging through the YouTube help system to find the settings for highest quality we find that they recommend MPEG4 as the container, using the  codec.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/youtube-recommended-settings.png"                      alt="youtube-recommended-settings"                ></p><p> We can also see further recommended settings in this screenshot that will be covered later.</p><p> The good news is that Premiere automatically selects the appropriate container for us when we select our codec, however it is worth knowing the file type YouTube is expecting just to check yourself.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Codec"><a href="#3-Video-Codec" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Codec"></a>3. Video Codec</h4><p> So having established that YouTube recommends the MPEG4 container using the  codec, the first option we need to look for in the media export dialogue is to select the appropriate Format.</p><p> This is the first drop down in the dialogue box, and in this case we simply select  from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/choosing-format.png"                      alt="choosing-format"                ></p><p> Once you select  you can check the ‘output name’ field and see that premiere is automatically set the output file to .mp4 which is exactly what we need.</p><h4 id="4-Preset"><a href="#4-Preset" class="headerlink" title="4. Preset"></a>4. Preset</h4><p> The next field we come to is the ‘Preset’ dropdown menu. This is a major help to most people, as Adobe have very kindly included large numbers of presets to quickly adapt video settings to suit specific uses. They vary depending on the exact version of Premiere you are using, and each format type does have its own list of presets,  as we can see has a large number for YouTube, but also has many presets for specific devices (presets for iPad, Kindle, Nook, various other tablets and phones, Vimeo and a host of others) to make getting the right settings that bit easier for us.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/presets.png"                      alt="presets"                ></p><p> It is important here to select the correct preset from the various YouTube options. You want to select the resolution and frame rate that match your source file, for the best results. So, if your source file is 1080p with a frame rate of 29.97 fps then that is the YouTube setting you would select.</p><p> Once a preset is selected a summary of the settings is displayed below, normally these will be well suited to your project, however you can fine tune anything you wish by selecting the video or audio tabs at the bottom which give you the chance to adjust each parameter individually. If you do this, you can save these changes as a custom preset by clicking the button at the side of the Preset dropdown menu and simply use it on later projects by selecting it from the list the same as any other, a great time saving tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/finetuning.png"                      alt="finetuning"                ></p><h4 id="5-Rendering"><a href="#5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="5. Rendering"></a>5. Rendering</h4><p> Once you are satisfied with the settings, either from the Preset alone or if you have adjusted anything yourself, you are nearly ready to render the file and export it.</p><p> For YouTube it is recommended you select the ‘Use Maximum Render Quality’ option to maintain the best output you can, it does add time to the render process but if you value the quality of your work it is worthwhile.</p><p> Finally you can choose a suitable filename and the destination of the file by clicking on the ‘Output Name’ field.</p><p> I normally use a filename that includes the destination medium so I can differentiate between different versions of a project and know which one to upload where, in this case I include ‘youtube’, but if I were planning on uploading clips of the project to vimeo as well for instance there may be a cut of the project with ‘vimeo’ in the name too. The destination is personal preference, because I do use filenames to differentiate versions I can put the various iterations into a single project file, others have folder structures for each type of file , so all YouTube output goes into a single folder and so on, how you organize is entirely dependent on how you work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/filename.png"                      alt="filename"                ></p><p> Once those are selected clicking ‘Export’ starts the rendering process, and eventually (how long depends on the speed of your computer and the size and type of file involved), you will end up with your YouTube optimized video in the location you chose.</p><p> Here I created 4 key frames that let the ‘Animation’ object move around the ‘Demo Text’ Object and finally come to rest below it. Whilst this type of effect does look very effective on screen, such is the ease of use of After Effects it really is just a few minutes work to achieve.</p><p> Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text in Premiere &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-Uploading"><a href="#6-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="6. Uploading"></a>6. Uploading</h4><p> Now you have your file, the next step is to go to your YouTube account and log in if you need to.</p><p> On the top of your homepage on the right is the upload button, selecting that brings up the select file menu as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/upload-menu.png"                      alt="upload-menu"                ></p><p> You can either drag your file into the window or click on it to open a standard file browser to locate the desired file, click and the upload will begin. The dropdown underneath allows you to set the video as Public, Unlisted or Private.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Complete-Guide-to-Aspect-Ratios-About-YouTube-Videos-Shorts-Ads"><a href="#A-Complete-Guide-to-Aspect-Ratios-About-YouTube-Videos-Shorts-Ads" class="headerlink" title="A Complete Guide to Aspect Ratios About YouTube Videos&#x2F;Shorts&#x2F;Ads"></a>A Complete Guide to Aspect Ratios About YouTube Videos&#x2F;Shorts&#x2F;Ads</h2><p>Yes, you are right. Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.</p><p>Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg"                      alt="youtube platform"                ></p><p>Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads](#Part 3)</p><p>04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos</h2><p>YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube aspect ratio"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar’s white or grey&#x2F;black area along the edges.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop&#x2F;PC Version:</p><p>If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:</p><p>There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version</p><p>Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.</p><p>Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg"                      alt="vertical video example"                ></p><p>Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio</h2><p>The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. The impact is seen in the field of the YouTube Video making process also with the introduction of YouTube Shorts. After following the short video trends of TikTok, this time YouTube appeared with its new feature YouTube Shorts, which allows a user to create a short video that ranges from 15 to 60 seconds. The only need is for a Smartphone and YouTube Application Shorts camera. And then you are good to go. Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube shorts ratio"                ></p><p>Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format. Following are the requirement for YouTube Shorts Ratio:</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Vertical format standard ratio is 9:16 (That fill up the entire screen vertically)</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> To comply with vertical format, the required resolution is 1920X1080 px.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is also provision for square videos with a 1:1 ratio for YouTube Shorts. But that results in extra white or black padding at the top and bottom areas.</p><p>Other possible YouTube Shorts ratios are 4:5, 2:3, 1:2.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads"><a href="#Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads"></a>Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads</h2><p>If you want to monetize from your video or Shorts, use YouTube Ads to generate additional income. Or, if you are already in some business and want to grow your business, do it with YouTube Ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-ads-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube-ads-aspect-ratio"                ></p><p>Now, you might be wondering, what would be the possible YouTube Outro size or YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for YouTube Ads?

You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.</p><p><strong>Be Professional</strong> – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.</p><p><strong>Relevant</strong> – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.</p><p><strong>Know every footage you are working with</strong> – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.</p><p><strong>Add new content</strong> – even though one content may suit several presentations, don’t rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.</p><h2 id="Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora"><a href="#Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora"></a>Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora</h2><p>The video quality matters when it comes to creating your Slides.

You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.</p><p><strong>Be Professional</strong> – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.</p><p><strong>Relevant</strong> – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.</p><p><strong>Know every footage you are working with</strong> – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.</p><p><strong>Add new content</strong> – even though one content may suit several presentations, don’t rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.</p><h2 id="Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Create-an-eye-catching-video-for-your-Slides-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora"></a>Create an eye-catching video for your Slides with Filmora</h2><p>The video quality matters when it comes to creating your Slides.

Silence everything you don’t want your microphone to record"></a><strong>1. Silence everything you don’t want your microphone to record</strong></h3><p>When you’re recording audio, you have to be more aware of the subtle sounds that drone on in your background. These sounds may include humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, and jingling from your pet’s collar. Observe your recording space and find ways to silence everything that you don’t want in your audio recording.</p><h3 id="2-Put-your-mobile-phone-in-airplane-mode"><a href="#2-Put-your-mobile-phone-in-airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Put your mobile phone in airplane mode"></a><strong>2. Put your mobile phone in airplane mode</strong></h3><p>Although it may be quite obvious to turn your phone’s ring tone off when you’re recording, it may not be as obvious to put your phone in airplane mode. When phones receive calls or perform searches as part of their background processes, they emit signals that can get picked up by your recording system. Avoid ruining good takes with unwanted sounds of phone signals by putting your phones in airplane mode.</p><h3 id="3-Minimize-echo"><a href="#3-Minimize-echo" class="headerlink" title="3. Minimize echo"></a><strong>3. Minimize echo</strong></h3><p>If you are recording yourself talk or sing, make sure to set up your recording space in a way where the sound projected from your voice bounces minimally off the walls and back to your microphone. Bare walls and hardwood floors will cause a lot of bouncing. Make use of materials that will absorb your sound rather than bounce it, like a thick rug or a comforter. If you want your voice to echo, that’s something you should do in post-production.</p><h3 id="4-Block-wind-from-reaching-your-microphone"><a href="#4-Block-wind-from-reaching-your-microphone" class="headerlink" title="4. Block wind from reaching your microphone"></a><strong>4. Block wind from reaching your microphone</strong></h3><p>Although it might not sound so loud and distracting to the naked ear, wind sounds terribly loud through a microphone recording and can cause your audio to clip (distortion of waveform due to output of sound exceeding maximum capacity or 0 dB point). This includes the “wind” that comes out of your mouth when you pronounce words starting with the letter “p.” Use pop filters, windscreens, and deadcats to block wind from reaching your microphone.</p><h3 id="5-Upgrade-your-microphone"><a href="#5-Upgrade-your-microphone" class="headerlink" title="5. Upgrade your microphone"></a><strong>5. Upgrade your microphone</strong></h3><p>As much as you try to control all the noise in your surroundings, your greatest recording limitation will come from the hardware that you use. Improve your recordings by plugging in an external microphone into your camera’s microphone jack or record audio completely separately with a professional microphone.</p><p>Need help with deciding on a microphone to buy? Check out our recommended list of microphones.</p><h3 id="6-Adjust-your-levels"><a href="#6-Adjust-your-levels" class="headerlink" title="6. Adjust your levels"></a><strong>6. Adjust your levels</strong></h3><p>Before pressing the record button, see how loudly your microphone picks up the sound you wish to record. Adjust your levels (sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound sits in between -6 dBs and -12dBs. This range gives the source of your sound some room to get louder without the recorded audio getting clipped. When you first listen to audio recorded within this range, it may sound very quiet. No need to worry though because you can increase the volume later in editing.</p><h3 id="7-Start-with-a-sound-cue-if-you’re-planning-to-do-some-syncing-in-post"><a href="#7-Start-with-a-sound-cue-if-you’re-planning-to-do-some-syncing-in-post" class="headerlink" title="7. Start with a sound cue if you’re planning to do some syncing in post"></a><strong>7. Start with a sound cue if you’re planning to do some syncing in post</strong></h3><p>If you’re recording separate audio that you plan to sync to your video later in editing, start your recording with a short and loud sound cue like a clap or a high pitched “beep” tone. Later, when you’re editing, it’ll be much easier for you to find the section where your video and additional audio match.</p><h3 id="8-Get-close-to-the-sound"><a href="#8-Get-close-to-the-sound" class="headerlink" title="8. Get close to the sound"></a><strong>8. Get close to the sound</strong></h3><p>Unless you’re aiming to record ambient sound, bring your microphone close to the source of sound you are wanting to record. The closer your microphone is to the source of sound, the lower your sensitivity setting can be on your microphone. As a result of lowering your levels, sounds you are not meaning to record will also sound fainter.</p><h3 id="9-ADR"><a href="#9-ADR" class="headerlink" title="9. ADR"></a><strong>9. ADR</strong></h3><p>When you need to record a scene in a loud setting where you have very little control over the noise, record additional vocals later and replace the original vocals through a process called automated dialogue replacement.</p><h3 id="10-Record-Ambient-Sound"><a href="#10-Record-Ambient-Sound" class="headerlink" title="10. Record Ambient Sound"></a><strong>10. Record Ambient Sound</strong></h3><p>Remember to record ambient sound or “room tone.” You can use these recordings to fill in the blanks if you run out of audio and also smooth out parts of your audio where you hear pops, clicks, and other unwanted noise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p><p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though. This article will walk you through signing up for a YouTube account, and give you some tips about starting your channel.</p><h2 id="Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps"><a href="#Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps"></a>Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account new gmail"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account after new gmail"                ></p><p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p><p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p><p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p><p>6. After you finish the form click Next Step and, in the next screen, Continue to YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel"></a>Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel</h2><h4 id="1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p><h4 id="5-Take-Inventory"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

Two of the main platforms are YouTube and Vimeo. This article tells you the difference between both so that you can decide which the best platform is for you. Whether you are a marketer, video producer or gamer you will find the information useful to find your target audience easily.</p><p>Also read:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full Review of Vimeo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vimeo Basic, Vimeo Plus or Vimeo Pro: Which is Right for You? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Please watch the video below for more information:</p><h2 id="Detailed-View-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo"><a href="#Detailed-View-of-YouTube-and-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Detailed View of YouTube and Vimeo"></a>Detailed View of YouTube and Vimeo</h2><h4 id="1-Communities"><a href="#1-Communities" class="headerlink" title="1  Communities"></a>1  Communities</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> When it comes to users YouTube comes out on top with over a billion views each and every month. You are able to interact with your viewers by using the comments and people are able to follow you so that they are notified of new videos and comments. As there is already a huge following on YouTube it’s easy to get a good following if you have great content. It’s harder to control public content which is a downside to using YouTube and there is very little customer support. With the comments being moderated rarely it can cause a distraction from your video. Businesses tend to internally block YouTube video’s which means you won’t get the viewings from people on their lunch breaks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-vs-youtube-communities.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-vs-youtube-communities"                ></p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> With higher quality content and no advertisements video owners can quickly build a valid following and gain comments from people that are contributing high value information. You have more detailed analytics which makes it easier to see where you are going wrong should you not have the following you want and you are able to use your own domain. With Google owning YouTube you are unlikely to get the same exposure you would, however the followers tend to be valid giving you a real idea of where you are going right or wrong. Because of the higher quality followers you are less likely to get negative or abusive comments when you use Vimeo, however it is a paid subscription with each tier giving you more space to upload.</p><h4 id="2-Membership"><a href="#2-Membership" class="headerlink" title="2  Membership"></a>2  Membership</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube on the other hand is free for all to use because the main focus is getting their equity through advertisements. There is however the option to take out a subscription which is known as YouTube Red. This lets you watch as many video’s as you want without having to view the ads and also gets you the ability to download so you don’t have to go online to view your favourite videos, a music app and original programming facilities.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> There are 4 different membership options with Vimeo allowing you to tailor it to your needs; there is the basic, plus, pro and business. The higher the cost, the greater level of support and storage capacity you will get. There is a free membership available but you will only be able to use up to 500MB each week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-membership.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-membership"                ></p><h4 id="3-Advertising"><a href="#3-Advertising" class="headerlink" title="3  Advertising"></a>3  Advertising</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> What makes YouTube free is the fact they get their money from the advertisements they put not only on their sites but before video’s that people have to watch a set amount of seconds for before they can view their video of choice. This is great news if you are a marketer as it will allow you to reach out to viewers on video’s that are relevant to your brand&#x2F;product&#x2F;service, however for those that are viewing the sheer amount of ads can be off-putting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-advertising.jpg"                      alt="youtube-advertising"                ></p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> As a paid subscription service and even the limited free package, you won’t have to view or show viewers ads, which means that your videos are more likely to be seen in their entirety not abandoned due to advertisements.</p><h4 id="4-Updating-video"><a href="#4-Updating-video" class="headerlink" title="4  Updating video"></a>4  Updating video</h4><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> If you upload videos to YouTube you do not have the same benefits as the only way to amend a video is to take it down, delete it and re-upload a new one. This unfortunately takes with it any statistics such as views that you have gained. If you do choose YouTube for your videos then do make sure you check everything vigorously before you upload it as there’s no way to change it.</p><p><strong>Vimeo:</strong> Occasionally an uploaded video may need some changes made. This could be due to changes to the offer you have or you have noticed something else that needs amending. With Vimeo if you need to update a video you can do so without losing the statistics it has already gained, which is great news if you notice an error later down the line or need to add or take something away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-uploading.jpg"                      alt="vimeo-uploading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes down to making the final decision between using YouTube or Vimeo you will need to look at the type of audience you want to attract. With Vimeo you are more likely to attract creators and film makers, whereas with YouTube you will have a bigger audience to target which gives you a better chance of a higher rank on search engines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-top-9-camera-extras-for-professional-level-vlogging-on-smartphones-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top 9 Camera Extras for Professional-Level Vlogging on Smartphones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-maximizing-impact-with-customized-youtube-audiences/"><u>[Updated] Maximizing Impact with Customized Youtube Audiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-explore-new-movie-landscapes-top-7-alternates/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Explore New Movie Landscapes - Top 7 Alternates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-tunes-takeover-transitioning-tracks-to-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Tunes Takeover  Transitioning Tracks to YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-skyrocket-your-youtube-speed-render-and-upload-hacks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Skyrocket Your YouTube Speed - Render and Upload Hacks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ecipe-rendezvous-top-30-channels-with-a-taste-for-success/"><u>[New] Recipe Rendezvous  Top 30 Channels with a Taste for Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-smooth-transition-from-phones-to-youtube-setting-up-personalbusiness-channels/"><u>In 2024, Smooth Transition From Phones to YouTube  Setting Up Personal/Business Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-step-by-step-guide-to-youtube-sound-placement/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Guide to Youtube Sound Placement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-ultimate-guide-top-freefire-streams-and-strategies-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Ultimate Guide  Top FreeFire Streams & Strategies on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/universal-unlock-pattern-for-itel-s23-by-drfone-android/"><u>Universal Unlock Pattern for Itel S23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhancing-visibility-and-following-on-instagram/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Enhancing Visibility & Following on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-apple-iphone-12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Apple iPhone 12? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-itel-p40-without-the-home-button-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Reset Itel P40 Without the Home Button | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/best-pfr-rate-to-elevate-sluggish-video-flow/"><u>Best PFR Rate to Elevate Sluggish Video Flow</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-negative-space-reverse-video-tricks-for-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Negative Space  Reverse Video Tricks for Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-conquering-common-challenges-easy-steps-for-your-ipad-capture-process/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Conquering Common Challenges  Easy Steps for Your iPad Capture Process</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-10-economical-pc-monitoring-and-capture-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 10 Economical PC Monitoring and Capture Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/a-working-guide-for-pachirisu-pokemon-go-map-on-tecno-spark-20c-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Tecno Spark 20C | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/top-tips-for-creating-highly-sharable-insta-unpacked-content/"><u>Top Tips for Creating Highly Sharable Insta Unpacked Content</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The more subscribers you attract, the more your videos will be viewed and shared online. In fact, YouTube confirms that subscribers watch double the number of videos non-subscribers do. So, getting more people to subscribe to your channel will certainly increase the number of views and engagement your videos get.</p><p>It’s no wonder the rate at which channels’ subscribers grow is an important metric in YouTube’s algorithm. The channels with the best rate of subscriber growth get featured. It’s not about suddenly skyrocketing to stardom, though. It’s about consistent growth.

MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS"></a><strong>1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS</strong></h2><p>This point is key. By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe. Subscribe links create a pop-up once viewers reach your channel. It’s a bold move that can give you instant results especially if you are referring traffic to your YouTube channel from other social media platforms.</p><p>All you need do is add ‘_?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1_’ at the end of all your YouTube links and there’ll be a pop-up whenever people click.</p><p>Now, it’s true that YouTube’s subscribe button isn’t exactly hidden. The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage. However, including your own subscribe link (via a YouTube card or in your video’s description) allows you to write a message that creates a sense of urgency which can produce fast results especially when people are really interested in watching your videos.</p><h2 id="2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS"><a href="#2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS" class="headerlink" title="2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS"></a><strong>2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS</strong></h2><p>Playlists have long been a part of our entertainment experience. Whether on our iPods or via apps like SoundCloud or Spotify, playlists make it easy for us to find and access the kind of content we like. But playlists aren’t just for music. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Creating playlists on your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a very smart move. It gives your subscribers and viewers added value they will appreciate. Part of the hassle of being online these days is trying to find the content you actually want to consume because you have to wade through so much content you aren’t actually interested in. By taking the work out of finding related content, you actually increase the chances that your viewers will stay longer on your channel and watch more of your videos.</p><p>You can also create playlists to curate content by other YouTube creators. As long as your curated content falls within your chosen category, and also complements your channel, you should go for it. In a way, creating curated playlists makes it easier to convince non-subscribed viewers that you understand the sort of content they like, and your channel is one to watch. Seeing that you know the best content and creators for a particular topic might just be the thing that convinces non-subscribed viewers to sign-on to receive updates from your channel.</p><h2 id="3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO"><a href="#3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO" class="headerlink" title="3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO"></a><strong>3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO</strong></h2><p>Most dedicated YouTube creators have made <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s their chance to give visitors a taste of what they’re all about in a short and exciting video. YouTube trailers are a sure way to hook viewers and you should definitely make one if you want to increase your channel subscribers fast.</p><p>YouTube channel trailers are usually under a minute long. In less than 60 seconds, you can showcase your best videos and get viewers excited about what you have to offer. You may choose to employ the sorts of clever videography we see in movie trailers. With so many open source and free video editing programs, doing this is actually not as difficult as you might think. The bottom line is that a YouTube trailer can be a creative and effective way of creating buzz about your channel and ultimately, growing your subscribers.</p><p>That said, you don’t have to make a YouTube channel trailer if you don’t want to. Setting a featured video can be just as effective. Featuring your most popular video will make a b first impression on people who visit your channel and increase the likelihood that they’ll click the subscribe button. Featuring your most recent video will keep your channel looking fresh.</p><h2 id="4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS"><a href="#4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS" class="headerlink" title="4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS"></a><strong>4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS</strong></h2><p>Adding your rival’s names to your tags might sound a bit underhanded, but it’s a fair way of increasing the chances that your content will show up as related to theirs. The trick is to choose rivals whose content ranks highest for the category or group related to your own content.</p><p>To find your rivals, simply search for your video titles. If your video is very popular and you’ve optimized it well enough, it may rank tops in your search. In most cases, however, the search results will show someone else’s content at the top of the list. Adding the names of the top 3 creators on that search list to your video’s tags will increase the likelihood that your video will be presented to viewers as related to theirs. When your video shows up as related to a top-ranking video, the chance that it will be viewed is increased significantly. And in addition, the more you are seen to create content that’s similar to the best videos, the more viewers are likely to subscribe to your channel.</p><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2><p>The tips on this list are simple, straightforward, and sure to deliver results.

There are multiple options out there, so how will you know if you’ve chosen the right one?</p><p>To help you decide better, we’ve designed a step-by-step guide that shows you exactly how to develop some excellent <strong>vlog channel name ideas</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Consider the Image You Want to Portray</strong></p><p>Vlog channel names often highlight the brand or person on the other end. While not the case for all, you will notice how many define their overall objective or mission. This can be ideal to begin when thinking of new Youtube channel names for vloggers. Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not when you select your vlog channel name.</p><p>It’s pretty vital that you, the channel owner, portray a message or an image that feels natural and provides your audience with an opportunity for best relation and recognition.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Stay Consistent with Your YouTube Niche</strong></p><p>The name you select must also reflect the niche upon which you based your channel. If you have a new channel, it can be hard to compete with more prominent vlog channels that cover important content topics. That’s why you should try to be particular and become the best at designing topics for the subject you’ve selected.</p><p>While you may get required exposure with a random name to grow your channel, it’s better, to begin with, something focal to the point.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Get a Feel for Your Target Audience</strong></p><p>Your target audience could be a huge factor in selecting the best name for a vlogging channel. Also, consider other vlog channels in the niche you’ve chosen and read through their video comments. Search out what your audience likes and vice versa. A precise scenario of your audience’s interests will allow you to choose the best name for a vlogging channel.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Keep Your Channel Name Short</strong></p><p>A YouTube channel name, or username, is max up to 60 characters, but generally, you get nowhere near that! Long channel names are not essential and can also be confusing to the viewers. They can also be tough to replicate or spell while searching. A concise, short username for your YouTube vlog channel can also give you the image of having more authority.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Make Your Channel Name Memorable</strong></p><p>Remember, if your YouTube vlog channel namebecomes excellent, this will be the name that everyone knows you by. It will be there with your videos, your playlists, and thumbnails. You don’t want a bad image that drags you downwards, but add creative writing tools like word plays, abbreviations, sibilance, alliteration, and puns to increase memorability.</p><h2 id="Part-3-50-Vlog-Channel-Names-Ideas-in-2022"><a href="#Part-3-50-Vlog-Channel-Names-Ideas-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 50+ Vlog Channel Names Ideas in 2022"></a>Part 3: 50+ Vlog Channel Names Ideas in 2022</h2><p>Strictly Cyber</p><p>Top Song Critic</p><p>Hashtag Hits</p><p>All Things Sports</p><p>The Virtual Coach</p><p>Game Hub</p><p>CyberLife</p><p>The Daily Cloud</p><p>Inner Sphere</p><p>Fashion Channel</p><p>Button Smasher</p><p>Numb thumbs</p><p>Gentle Gamer</p><p>Headset Hero</p><p>Headset Heaven</p><p>Headset Habitat &#x2F; Home</p><p>Headset Hub</p><p>Gorgeous Gamer</p><p>Avatar auditions</p><p>3D Josh</p><p>abroad broad</p><p>adventures abroad</p><p>van life</p><p>[country] life</p><p>van fan</p><p>suitcase suckers</p><p>hotel hobbyists</p><p>travel treats</p><p>transit travel</p><p>travel tricks</p><p>life (long) lovers</p><p>love [name]</p><p>lovebirds</p><p>hug my husband &#x2F; housewife &#x2F; boyfriend &#x2F; girlfriend</p><p>husband at home</p><p>cuddle my girlfriend</p><p>couples paradise</p><p>trouble in paradise</p><p>couple productions</p><p>couples therapy</p><p>in a nutshell</p><p>tutorial hero</p><p>info nuggets</p><p>[name] teaches [topic]</p><p>[topic] by [name]</p><p>learning [topic]</p><p>curiosity satisfied</p><p>[topic] academy &#x2F; school &#x2F; tutorials &#x2F; teacher &#x2F; made easy &#x2F; explained &#x2F; for beginners</p><p>edu owl</p><p>nothing too difficult</p><h2 id="Part-4-Top-5-Free-Vlog-Channel-Name-Generators-in-2022"><a href="#Part-4-Top-5-Free-Vlog-Channel-Name-Generators-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Top 5 Free Vlog Channel Name Generators in 2022"></a><strong>Part 4: Top 5 Free Vlog Channel Name Generators in 2022</strong></h2><p>There are numerous ways to personalizing a cool YouTube vlog channel nameor brainstorm fantastic vlog channel name ideas.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations"><a href="#Technical-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial.

If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template.

This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event’s theme.</li><li><strong>Format and Compatibility:</strong> They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters-1"><a href="#Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?"></a>Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?</h2><p>Every DJ out there has their own unique style.

For instance, a Fullscreen partnership agreement requires you to share a percentage of your revenue in exchange for access to Fullscreen’s partnership perks. These perks include customized thumbnails as well as channel banners.</p><h3 id="How-to-Get-a-Fullscreen-Partnership"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-Fullscreen-Partnership" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a Fullscreen Partnership"></a>How to Get a Fullscreen Partnership</h3><p>Now that we’ve covered what the partnership actually is, let’s go ahead and take a look at how to actually become a Fullscreen partner. There are a few things that you should take into account before deciding to go down this road. There are regulations that your account needs to abide by. Let’s take a look:</p><ol><li>Your account cannot have any copyright strikes and must be in good standing.</li><li>Your channel needs to be at least 30 days old.</li><li>You must have at least 1,000 subscribers.</li><li>You need to have received at least 100 views per day for the last 30 days.</li></ol><p>If you meet these requirements, and Fullscreen sounds like a good fit for you, go ahead and <a class="link"   href="http://fullscreenmedia.co/apply/" >apply for partnership <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The first thing that you need to do is go to the Fullscreen website and find the Channels page. Scroll to the lowest point and request more information. Click the button to trigger the appearance of a form and write a message to Fullscreen. Once you’ve sent your message, Fullscreen is going to take between 1 and 7 days to respond. If accepted, you will have to sign a contract and provide screenshots that confirm that your account is in good standing on the YouTube.</p><h3 id="How-Fullscreen-Pays-You"><a href="#How-Fullscreen-Pays-You" class="headerlink" title="How Fullscreen Pays You"></a>How Fullscreen Pays You</h3><p>You’ve entered into a partnership agreement – now you need to start getting paid. The process is simple.</p><p>Fullscreen will pay you through PayPal. They will calculate how much you’ve earned, and you will get that amount transferred to your account. Make sure to check the amount that you’ve earned from the dashboard of Fullscreen itself.</p><p>Becoming a Fullscreen partner might be a good idea for your channel if the perks appeal to you.
