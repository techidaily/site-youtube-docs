All you need to do to access it is, sign in to your Google account, tap the <strong>+</strong> button at the bottom, and tap <strong>Create a Short</strong> in the popup box that comes up.</p><ol><li><strong>What if YouTube Shorts is not showing on my YouTube app?</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that your YouTube app is updated to its latest version. If the app is already updated, and <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still unavailable, the chances are that Google hasn’t rolled the app in your region. Since <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still in its Beta phase, only the region of India can use all the functions of the app at the time of this writing. In such a case, you are suggested to wait until the <strong>YouTube Shorts app</strong> is made available for your location.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts video duration?</strong></li></ol><p>A <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> video can be of only up to 60 seconds.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts size limitation?</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube hasn’t provided any information related to this as of now. However, you can rest assure that a 60 seconds long video file wouldn’t be too large for YouTube to handle.</p><ol><li><strong>How many subs do you need to access Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is available for everyone regardless of the number of subscribers the channel has.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you make money on Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p>Unfortunately, NO. Although you cannot monetize the recordings published as <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong>, they can be a good source to drive subscribers to your main YouTube channel that may have the videos that can be monetized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-skyrocketing-to-million-dollar-views-best-hashtags/"><u>[New] In 2024, Skyrocketing to Million-Dollar Views Best Hashtags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-step-by-step-to-success-joining-youtubes-partner-program/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step-by-Step to Success Joining YouTube's Partner Program</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-a-treasure-trove-of-9-complete-holiday-flicks-free-streaming-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Treasure Trove of 9 Complete Holiday Flicks, Free Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-fitness-frontiers-youtubes-best-yoga-content-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Fitness Frontiers - YouTube's Best Yoga Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-ensuring-your-shorts-videos-thumbnail-shows-up/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Ensuring Your Shorts Video's Thumbnail Shows Up</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-from-script-to-screen-youtube-studio-editing-workshop-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Script to Screen YouTube Studio Editing Workshop Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/extending-the-lifespan-intel-discloses-inclusive-warranty-terms-for-core-i5-i7-and-i9-chips-in-13th-gen-and-beyond/"><u>Extending the Lifespan: Intel Discloses Inclusive Warranty Terms for Core I5, I7 & I9 Chips in 13Th Gen and Beyond</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-digital-diary-keepers-securely-download-tweets-videos/"><u>In 2024, Digital Diary Keepers Securely Download Tweets' Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-snapchat-location-spoofer-to-protect-your-privacy-on-vivo-y78plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Vivo Y78+? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/introductory-kit-review-kid-approved-waterproof-cams/"><u>Introductory Kit Review: Kid-Approved Waterproof Cams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/mastering-multimedia-production-a-guide-to-editing-videos-on-windows-10/"><u>Mastering Multimedia Production A Guide to Editing Videos on Windows 10</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

These looping videos are fascinating and fun to watch. A loop is a popular element in photography and especially music videos, the idea being that the camera appears to magically repeat itself as many times as there are photos or frames showing the action. They can also simply recur a sequence a certain number of times, then stop.</p><p>Now some people don’t know how to make looping videos, so in this article, we are going to discuss <strong>how to loop a video on iPhone videos</strong> and also how to loop YouTube videos on iPhone.

Loop videos can be created with features on social media apps and third-party apps.</p><p>iPhone has a setting that allows you to edit the photos to loop or bounce videos, and it only works with a photo feature called ‘live photo’. The live photo feature records 1.5 seconds moving picture when you click on the shutter button.</p><p>The live photo feature can be edited to create a loop video, and you can do that by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Before creating the video, you need to have the live picture saved on your phone.</li></ol><p>To do this, capture a live photo by opening your camera app. Then click on the live photo icon, which is located in the upper right corner. And tap on the shutter button.</p><ol><li>Afterward, you locate the live photo you want to convert to a loop video by going to the Photos apps.

The type of font, color, and size also plays an important role in catching the attention of the audience.</p><h4 id="4-Make-Color-Contrast-between-the-text-and-background"><a href="#4-Make-Color-Contrast-between-the-text-and-background" class="headerlink" title="4.

Keep Your Audience’s Attention:"></a><strong>1. Keep Your Audience’s Attention:</strong></h2><p>Even though your view count is going up, it doesn’t mean your audience is watching your video. And if they are not, then YouTube is going to consider your video less valuable and therefore, lowering its rank.</p><p>Audience Retention is an important metric to keep an eye on after every video you’ve published.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/measurign-audience-retention.png.png"                      alt="low-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Before you start your next project, take a look back at the Audience Retention of your previous videos.  </p><ol><li>Enter YouTube Studio in your channel</li><li>Access to Analytics</li><li>Select the video you want to review</li><li>Click into engagement</li><li>See where a dip in watch time</li></ol><h3 id="What-is-Good-Audience-Retention"><a href="#What-is-Good-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="What is Good Audience Retention?"></a><strong>What is Good Audience Retention?</strong></h3><p>If you want to see how your Audience Retention is performing, the Average Percentage Viewed will give you a broad perspective. The higher the percentage, the more people are watching your entire video.</p><p>If you get above <strong>60%</strong> Average Percentage Viewed, you should feel very proud. In our modern world with our short attention span, that is considered good retention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-one.png"                      alt="audience-retention-one"                ></p><p>In the example above, we see that on average, a viewer will only see 44% of the video. For the video below, we see that it only has 30% of the video viewed. Overall, the first video is performing better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-two.jpg"                      alt="audience-retention-two"                ></p><p>There is also a dip that happens at the beginning in the second example, which indicates that viewers are skipping forward and about 20% then deciding it’s not worth continuing. It’s good data to help you improve your introduction and the hook.</p><p>If there is important information that you are presenting at a given point and in the Audience Retention you see that only a small percentage of your viewers actually see it, then for the next video, you might want to position the details in a different point in the video.</p><h3 id="How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention"><a href="#How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="How to Improve Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Improve Audience Retention</strong></h3><p>Here are a few ways you can retain your audience’s attention if you noticed a drop in viewership:</p><p><strong>- Film a hook</strong> (introduce your video to let the audience know what to expect)</p><p><strong>- Add b-roll</strong> (having supplemental footage to cut to makes your video more interesting to watch)</p><p><strong>- Have a co-host</strong> (Having someone on screen gives the video more dynamic interactions)</p><p><strong>- Edit out the unimportant stuff</strong></p><p><strong>- Write a conclusion</strong> (having a conclusion prepared will allow you to transition from the content of the video to the call to action without the audience even knowing) See this example by PolyMatter below and notice how seamless their ending is.</p><p>If you have a video that is doing a good job retaining the audience, then replicate it. If there isn’t, keep experimenting with new structures. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Improving audience retention <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is not simply important for your ranking, but it will affirm that you are building quality videos.</p><p>Knowing how to structure your video will allow you to be strategic as you build out your content.</p><h2 id="2-Do-Keyword-Research"><a href="#2-Do-Keyword-Research" class="headerlink" title="2.

Study the Competitors:</strong> See which videos are ranking high for your search term. Use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to see the keywords that the top videos are performing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/vidlq-tool.jpg"                      alt="vidlq-tool"                ></p><p><strong>3.

The higher the number the more popular it is. You should aim to use keywords with a high search volume.</p><p><strong>Keyword competition score:</strong> This score is usually indicated by a number and it represents how difficult it is for a keyword to rank due to other pages already ranking for that word or phrase. You want to find a keyword with a low competition score.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The best combination is high search volume and low competition score. But if you can’t get that perfect mix, go for the low competitive score, as it will give you a better chance to rank, even if it isn’t searched as often.</p><p><strong>4. Come Up With Content Related to Those Keywords:</strong> To come up with topic ideas around a keyword, you can use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://answerthepublic.com/" >Answer the Public <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which gives you all the most popular questions searched online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/answer-the-public.jpg"                      alt="answer-the-public"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052062/7443" target="_top" id="2052062">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052062" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052062/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Engage-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Engage-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3.

Engage Your Audience:</strong></h2><p>It’s been highly discussed on forums all over the Internet, and there appears to be a strong correlation between <a class="link"   href="https://backlinko.com/youtube-ranking-factors" >YouTube video ranking and the number of likes, dislikes, and comments <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the video received.</p><p>While YouTube itself might not be using the number of likes and comments to determine where your video rank, having high engagement allows your video to be discovered through other means.</p><p>Here is an example of how it would work:</p><p>- A YouTuber with 100,000 subscribers views your video and likes it</p><p>- Then your video might be visible to a fraction of those 100,000 subscribers.</p><p>- Boom! Domino effect!</p><p>- More people will see your video and like it, increasing your network of viewers and your watch time, which is one of the main factors that YouTube takes into consideration.</p><p> <strong>Get engagements with a call to action</strong>:</p><p>- Don’t be afraid to ask for an engagement at the beginning of the video to avoid fall off on retention.</p><p>- Encourage them to leave a comment or start a discussion by asking a question at the end of your video.</p><p>- Monitor comments and responds to them so you can build a relationship with your audience over time.</p><p>It’s all about creating a community and that is what YouTube encourages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105863/7443" target="_top" id="2105863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105863/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length"><a href="#4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length" class="headerlink" title="4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:"></a><strong>4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:</strong></h2><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on watch time, and in addition to that, it puts more weight on session watch time.</p><p>Session watch time is counted when people watch your video and then continue to watch others, it doesn’t have to be your own. The more time people spend watching YouTube videos, as a result of your content, the more likely YouTube will increase your ranking.</p><p>Since YouTube puts importance on time spent watching videos, the length of your video will play a key role.</p><p>If you have 5 videos and all of them are a minute long, a 100% watch through will only get you 5 minutes total.</p><p>However, if you have 1 video that is 20 minutes, and an average viewer only watches half of it, then you have an average watch time of over 10 minutes. <strong>That’s more than double what your five short videos can do.</strong> This longer video is worth more. However, if that 20-minute video is really boring and people drop off in the first minute, then it’s not any better than 1 of the 5 short videos.</p><p>If your format allows, go for a longer video instead of a shorter one. But the most important thing is that you can keep people watching your videos: so use end screen and playlist links to keep them engaged.</p><p><strong>End screen:</strong> Pick related videos for your audience, so they know exactly what they should watch next. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a background template for your end screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/related-videos-for-your-audience.jpg"                      alt="related-videos-for-your-audience"                ></p><p><strong>Playlist</strong>: If you have multiple videos that fit a specific topic, add them to a playlist so the viewer can enjoy them all in one viewing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/add-videos-of-the-same-topic-to-a-playlist.jpg"                      alt="add-videos-of-the-same-topic-to-a-playlist"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135397/19272" target="_top" id="2135397">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135397" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135397/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways:"></a><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h4><ol><li>Use <strong>Audience Retention</strong> to better understand how to structure your video for the best results.</li><li>Perform <strong>Keyword Research</strong> to find the keywords that your competitors are using and your audience is searching for.</li><li><strong>Increasing Subscribers</strong> gets your video in front of more people the moment it is published.</li><li><strong>Encourage Comments</strong> and respond to establish a relationship with your viewers.</li><li>Ensure that <strong>Viewers Continue Watching</strong> videos on YouTube after they finish watching yours.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137976/21526" target="_top" id="2137976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137976/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Other-Things-That-Affects-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#Other-Things-That-Affects-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="Other Things That Affects Your YouTube Ranking"></a><strong>Other Things That Affects Your YouTube Ranking</strong></h2><p>Except for the above-mentioned factors, there are also other issues that affect the ranking of your YouTube video.

However, the case is quite different when it comes to YouTube Shorts eligibility.</p><p>The YouTube Shorts Fund only has a single requirement of eligibility criteria to know how to join the YouTube Shorts fund. You have to create original yet lovely content for the viewers.</p><p>You don’t have to be the YouTube Partner Program’s part, nor does your channel have to meet its requirements for monetization. The Shorts Fund is open to each creator.</p><p><strong>YouTube will directly reach out to creators about the fund.</strong></p><p>So far, there’s not a direct way of application for the YouTube Shorts Fund. Creators can’t request an invitation or enroll themselves in the fund. The only way you can join the fund is via a direct YouTube invitation.</p><p>YouTube will divide this fund from the Shorts Fund on a rolling basis. The creators who’ve received the highest amounts of views and engagement levels on their YouTube Shorts will receive the rewards. They plan to reach out to multiples of creators each month.</p><p><strong>It will help if you keep creating great content to prepare for the YouTube Shorts fund.</strong></p><p>The best way you can create is to keep uploading excellent content. You can use this time to become a pro at creating compelling YouTube Shorts among the broader audience base.

Choose a Good Video Editor"></a>1. Choose a Good Video Editor</h3><p>One of the first things you have to do is make sure that you have chosen a video editor that is best for you.</p><p>Using either too complicated or too basic a video editor can only create problems for you. An advanced video editor may create very high-end, professional videos, but it will take months just to get the hang of the software. Whereas a free basic video editor may not give as many options as you’d need to edit your videos properly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Use-Fast-Computers"><a href="#2-Use-Fast-Computers" class="headerlink" title="2.

To improve your current PC, you can invest in an SSD, which is a lot faster than the traditional hard disk.</p><p>SSD will not only improve your export, loading, and rendering time but it will allow you to access files and editing software much faster. Another improvement you can make to make your editing process faster is to increase the RAM of your computer (it should be at least 8 GB). Also, make sure to get the recommended video card and processor for your video editor.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049382/7443" target="_top" id="2049382">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049382" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049382/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Invest-Your-Time-in-Video-Editing-Tutorials"><a href="#3-Invest-Your-Time-in-Video-Editing-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="3.

Here Are the 7 Main Culprits of Slow Phone Wi-Fi"></a>Experiencing Sluggish Mobile Connectivity? Here Are the 7 Main Culprits of Slow Phone Wi-Fi</h2><p> Since smartphones are the primary way most people connect to the internet, getting the fastest possible internet speeds on your mobile devices is more important than ever.</p><p> But that doesn’t always happen. There are lots of problems that can slow the Wi-Fi speed on your phone down. Let’s take a look at the main reasons why the internet connection is so slow on your phone, and how you can increase your Wi-Fi speed.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Poor-Router-Position"><a href="#1-Poor-Router-Position" class="headerlink" title="1. Poor Router Position"></a>1. Poor Router Position</h2><p> One of the main reasons your phone’s Wi-Fi is slow is that you’ve got your router positioned in the wrong place.</p><p> Depending on the specs and design of your router, the signal can have a range of up to a few hundred feet. But the further it travels, the slower it gets. The Wi-Fi signal can be blocked by large physical objects, like walls, floors, and doors too.</p><p> So if you’re a long distance from the router—like in the furthest bedroom in your house, or even outside—the speeds you get might be a lot slower than you’d expect.</p><p> There’s a quick way to test this. The Wi-Fi icon on your phone’s status bar gives you a rough indication of the signal strength.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wifi-signal-icons.jpeg"                      alt="wifi signal icons"                ></p><ul><li>When the icon is full, you’ve got a strong signal. This suggests your slow internet has a different cause.</li><li>When it’s empty, or nearly empty, your signal is weak. Other Wi-Fi devices like your laptop should also be affected at these long distances. When you move closer to your router, your signal strength—and internet speed—should improve.</li></ul><p> When the weak signal does improve as you get closer, it shows that your router’s position is the problem.

Routers broadcast their signal on a specified channel, but if your neighbors have their routers set to the same channel, it can become congested and degrade the performance for everyone.</p><p> This can be a problem in apartment blocks especially, where you have a lot of routers crammed into a relatively small area.</p><p> To fix this, you need to use software that can help you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-change-wifi-channel/" >find the best channel for your router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Both apps are free.</p><h2 id="3-Wi-Fi-Noise"><a href="#3-Wi-Fi-Noise" class="headerlink" title="3. Wi-Fi Noise"></a>3. Wi-Fi Noise</h2><p> As well as interference from other nearby routers, Wi-Fi is also susceptible to noise from appliances in your home. Devices like microwaves, wireless doorbells, and cordless phones can interfere with the signal from a router running on the 2.4GHz band.</p><p> Most modern routers can work on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. The latter is a lot less prone to interference. If you’ve got a fairly recent router that supports this, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-things-must-brand-new-router/" >delve into the router’s settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to enable 5GHz broadcasting.</p><p> Before you do this, though, you need to make sure all your connected devices—not just your phone—support 5GHz, or they’ll no longer be able to connect. Many modern routers are dual-band, meaning they can broadcast on both bands simultaneously. If you don’t have one of these, you’ll have to choose either one or the other.</p><p> If you’re sticking with 2.4GHz, make sure you don’t have any other devices near your router that could cause interference. And prepare for possible disruption if you’re streaming Netflix while standing in the kitchen making microwave popcorn.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-You’re-Connected-to-a-Slow-Network"><a href="#4-You’re-Connected-to-a-Slow-Network" class="headerlink" title="4.

Streaming movies, downloading video games, or installing operating system updates will all cause a slowdown in your general internet use.</p><p> On public Wi-Fi, the speeds you’ll get can vary wildly, and you shouldn’t rely on getting a superfast service from something you aren’t paying for. However, even after checking your expectations, you might still end up getting far worse performance than you could.</p><p> There are so many public Wi-Fi hotspots, and your phone is liable to latch onto one of them at random. It’ll often even stay connected after you’ve moved into the range of a closer or better one. This means that while your favorite coffee shop might have fantastic Wi-Fi, there’s no guarantee you’ll connect to it every time.</p><p> A good way to work around this is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wifi-network-priority-android-iphone/" >set the Wi-Fi network priority <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Android or iPhone. This forces your device to always connect to one of your chosen networks whenever you’re in range, and only use other free hotspots as a last resort.</p><h2 id="5-You’re-Using-a-Slow-VPN"><a href="#5-You’re-Using-a-Slow-VPN" class="headerlink" title="5.

One reason for this could be that you’ve started using a VPN, which gives you more security and privacy online.</p><p> But did you know that your choice of VPN can have a significant effect on your internet speed?</p><p> Free VPN apps are notorious for offering terrible performance.

When you switch to mobile data, you’d expect your connection to be as fast or even faster than Wi-Fi. But this isn’t always true.</p><p> There are so many things that can affect your phone signal. You’ll see this manifest often in crowded places, like at a sporting event or concert. When tens of thousands of people are trying to connect to the same cell tower at the same time, performance suffers.</p><p> And there are other potential factors, too. Your distance from the nearest tower, whether you’re indoors or outdoors, and even the weather can have an effect.</p><p> So you might have a 5G phone, but 5G coverage could be patchy enough that you might not benefit from it. And some of these issues can even cause a 4G phone to fall back to a slower 3G connection; others might leave you with no internet connection at all.</p><p> In addition, smaller mobile carriers might have more limited bandwidth, meaning you may never get up to top speed on those. Speak to your carrier if you have ongoing problems. If there’s no solution, it may be time to change to a better provider.</p><h2 id="7-Your-Phone-Is-Slow"><a href="#7-Your-Phone-Is-Slow" class="headerlink" title="7. Your Phone Is Slow"></a>7. Your Phone Is Slow</h2><p> Finally, slow phone internet might just be a sign of a slow phone. Your Wi-Fi connection may be great, your mobile data coverage perfect, and you’re on a fast network. But maybe your phone just can’t keep up with what you’re asking it to do.</p><p> The resource requirements of apps and websites creep up all the time. So even when your actual internet speed is good, you might still perceive it to be slow. The phone’s hardware might be taking its time rendering a webpage, for example, or struggling to handle the graphics in an online game.</p><p> You can see this on older phones and lower-end Android phones especially. But even if you’ve got an up-to-date, high-end device, your choice of apps can still have an impact. Too many apps downloading and syncing in the background can hog too much of your available bandwidth.</p><p> Older or poorly written apps can make your phone slow generally. Make sure to keep your apps up to date,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/find-and-delete-unused-apps-android/" >uninstall apps that you don’t use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and keep an eye on which are allowed to run in the background. And in extreme cases, it might even be time to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/upgrading-smartphone-questions/" >consider whether it’s worth buying a new smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151890/7443" target="_top" id="2151890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Is-My-Phone’s-Internet-So-Slow-Now-You-Understand"><a href="#Why-Is-My-Phone’s-Internet-So-Slow-Now-You-Understand" class="headerlink" title="Why Is My Phone’s Internet So Slow?

One of the most important things you need to get out of the way is the business name. Once you have settled on a fitting name, you will then move on to create a sign to place outside your shop.</p><p>For example, a banner for your YouTube gaming channel plays a similar role to signage for a brick-and-mortar shop.</p><ul><li>An excellent banner helps you make a solid first impression on your viewers, some of who is viewing your content for the first time.</li><li>Secondly, a well-designed banner reflects positively on your brand and helps you grow your audience at a steady rate.</li><li>Thirdly, you can use your banner to give your viewers a rough idea of what your video is about without them clicking to watch.

Therefore, it would be wise to get the size right if you want to create an excellent first impression for yourself. Ideally, the best size for a YouTube banner is 2560*1440 pixels or an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p><p>We urge you not to upload a banner smaller than 2048*1152 pixels, or else the image will appear cropped.

If your YouTube banner has too many elements, your viewers using their mobile phones might have a challenge viewing the image.</p><p>Ensure the graphics are high-quality : Nothing is as frustrating to your viewers as seeing a blurry or pixelated YouTube banner. However, high-quality graphics with a resolution of at least 1920*1080 pixels make your work look polished and attract more viewers to your channel.</p><p>Leverage the grid system: Some of your viewers might watch your videos from their smartphones, and others on their laptops or tablets. The grid system allows you to ensure the full banner will be visible no matter what device your audience will use to watch your gaming videos.</p><p>Add a CTA: At the end of the day, you are trying to grow your audience on your YouTube channel. You might also have other social media platforms where you post content. Since your banner is one of the first things your audience will see, you could include a short, easy-to-read, and understandable call to action. For instance, you could encourage them to “Subscribe Now!”</p><p>Incorporate your unique color scheme: By now, you already have a theme for your YouTube channel that your existing subscribers associate with you. As you design your YouTube banner, ensure you incorporate your theme colors, so new visitors know what colors to look out for as they scroll on the platform.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-Templates-To-Create-Gaming-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Why-Use-Templates-To-Create-Gaming-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Templates To Create Gaming YouTube Banners?"></a>Why Use Templates To Create Gaming YouTube Banners?</h2><p>First and foremost, a gaming youtube banner template takes the tedium out of creating a design from scratch.

Something that may have been surprising was the amount of equipment it takes to run a successful vlog. Besides your camera you need equipment for stabilizing it, for lighting your shots, and for recording better audio than your camera is capable of. If you still don’t know which camera to use, this article will tell you the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best cameras for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Do not be overwhelmed! There are loads of affordable options for YouTube equipment. There are even some tricks you can use to get by without some pieces of equipment until you are ready to make the investment.</p><p>Here are examples of some of the best YouTube equipment. Watch for the ‘Free Option!’ at the bottom of every section!</p><h4 id="1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube"><a href="#1-Stabilizers-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>1. Stabilizers for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Selfie Stick:</strong> A lot of vloggers like to record from their phones, and selfie sticks make great stabilizers. You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a ‘selfie stick on steroids’. It is a pricier option at $350.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment01.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod:</strong> A tripod is what most people think of when they think of stabilizing their cameras. Tripods come in different weights and sizes, and there are even tripods specifically for smartphones. There is a wide range of pricing for tripods. Mid-range is about $50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment02.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! Any Available Surface:</strong> Kitchen tables. Desks. Park benches. Trees. Your friend’s shoulder, if you ask nicely. Anything you can rest your camera on top of can be used to record a steady video.</p><h4 id="2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#2-Lighting-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Lighting for YouTube Videos"></a>2. Lighting for YouTube Videos</h4><p><strong>Softbox Lights:</strong> These are the kinds of lights that were probably used to take your school photos. They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>LED Panel Light:</strong> LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option! The Sun:</strong> Natural light is always powerful enough to make your videos look great. Consider recording outside, or near a window in your house.</p><h4 id="3-Audio-Equipment-for-YouTube"><a href="#3-Audio-Equipment-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="3. Audio Equipment for YouTube"></a>3. Audio Equipment for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Snoball:</strong> A Blue Snoball USB mic is an extremely affordable option at $60, although it does not have good range. You have to stay close to your computer if you use a Snoball.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment05.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Shotgun:</strong> You can get a shotgun mic to attach to your camera at a fairly decent price. The RØDE Video Shotgun Mic is only $140. You will not be able to stray far from your camera as it works best when you are close to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment06.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>MP3 Recorder:</strong> A very high quality voice recorder is one way to record great audio and still be able to move freely. The Roland R-05 WAVE&#x2F;MP3 Recorder is a great choice at $200.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment07.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p> <strong>LAV System:</strong> A lavalier, or lapel, mic system is a lot of vloggers’ favorite way to record dialogue because the mics are small and clip right on to your clothing. This is a more expensive option. The Sony LAV Wireless Mic System is $600.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment08.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p> <strong>Free Option! Audacity:</strong>  Audacity is free audio recording&#x2F;editing software that is popular with vloggers. If you do not have access to an external mic then you might be able to increase the quality of your sound recording using Audacity. You can download the latest version of Audacity for free from Audacityteam.org</p><h4 id="4-Editing-Your-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#4-Editing-Your-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4.

This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube.

At the end of all your videos, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and like your social media page.</p><p>Don’t forget to explain the benefits of subscribing to them, such as to benefit from your informative tips and gain a deeper insight into your projects.

Listen To Your Subscribers"></a>3. Listen To Your Subscribers</h3><p>It feels nice to get positive comments on your videos. If people feel comfortable enough to leave you suggestions and requests then that is even better. It means that you have succeeded in making them feel like they are part of your community.</p><p>If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions. If the majority of your subscribers enjoy your jokes and you get one comment telling you to stop trying to be funny then it is fairly obvious that that ‘suggestion’ does not really reflect the wishes of your community.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subscriber02.JPG"                      alt="get subscriber"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-your-title"><a href="#4-Optimize-your-title" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize your title"></a>4. Optimize your title</h3><p>Try not to underestimate the importance of a great eye-catching title. Include relevant words and phrases that you think people will search for and don’t just hastily add the first title that comes into your head. The better your title is, the more viewers and subscribers you are likely to amass.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/optimize-title.JPG"                      alt="title"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151868/7443" target="_top" id="2151868">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151868" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151868/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Be-Patient"><a href="#5-Be-Patient" class="headerlink" title="5.

It takes a lot of patience to keep producing content on a regular schedule when it seems like not many people are watching, but you need to stick with it in order to grow.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-more-Subscribers-on-YouTube-for-Pros"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-more-Subscribers-on-YouTube-for-Pros" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Get more Subscribers on YouTube for Pros"></a>Part 2: How to Get more Subscribers on YouTube for Pros</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Set-goals"><a href="#1-Set-goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Set goals"></a>1. Set goals</h3><p>You can gain extra drive and momentum by setting yourself attainable goals and encouraging your followers to help you achieve them. These goals can include milestones such as reaching 500 followers, 1,000 followers and so on. Don’t hesitate to tell your viewers about these goals – if they think your content is of real value, chances are they will be only too happy to assist you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-goals.JPG"                      alt="goals"                ></p><h3 id="2-Contests-can-be-funny-–-why-not-enter-one"><a href="#2-Contests-can-be-funny-–-why-not-enter-one" class="headerlink" title="2. Contests can be funny – why not enter one?"></a>2. Contests can be funny – why not enter one?</h3><p>One way to increase subscribers is to take part in a contest. A site called Gleam can oversee a contest for you. It’s up to you to choose how you want the contest to work, and you can gain an edge over your competitors by getting people to leave comments, follow you on Instagram, subscribe to your channel and more.</p><p>You will be provided with a landing page for promoting your channel, and you can share this in a variety of places, including on your Facebook, Twitter and blog. The best way to heighten your chances of success is to have a clear goal in mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-contest.JPG"                      alt="video0 contest"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-a-trailer"><a href="#3-Make-a-trailer" class="headerlink" title="3. Make a trailer"></a>3. Make a trailer</h3><p>YouTube’s channel interface allows you to add a <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3031012/9-short-storytelling-tips-from-a-master-of-movie-trailers" >trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to entice viewers into watching your videos and following you on the platform. Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.</p><p>Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become. And here are some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best trailer makers that you can use on both Windows and Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-killer-youtube-channel-trailer.jpg"                      alt="trailer"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It"></a>4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It</h3><p>You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.</p><p>Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers"><a href="#5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers"></a>5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers</h3><p>Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.</p><p>Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cooperation.JPG"                      alt="cooperation"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]"></a>Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]</h2><p>There are lots of ways to get free YouTube subscribers. This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.</p><p>In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don’t need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144276/7443" target="_top" id="2144276">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144276" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144276/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche"><a href="#1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche" class="headerlink" title="1.

Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.</p><h3 id="2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like"><a href="#2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like" class="headerlink" title="2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like"></a>2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like</h3><p>Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.</p><p>It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel’s owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.</p><h3 id="3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day"><a href="#3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day" class="headerlink" title="3.

Spend time watching videos each day</h3><p>Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.</p><p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return" class="headerlink" title="4.

Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p><p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p><h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p><p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115946/19272" target="_top" id="2115946">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115946" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115946/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again" class="headerlink" title="6.

Leave Room"></a>1. Leave Room</h4><p>If you know you are going to add text to your video then make sure you leave room for it in your frame. Consider standing off to one side instead of directly in front of your camera. You do not want to have to choose between not using text, making your text really small, or placing it over your face.</p><p>While planning out your frame and leaving room for your text, consider what color you are going to make the words and whether it will stand out and look good against your background.</p><h4 id="2-Bigger-is-Better"><a href="#2-Bigger-is-Better" class="headerlink" title="2. Bigger is Better"></a>2. Bigger is Better</h4><p>People should be able to read your text without putting in any extra effort, such as straining their eyes to make out small words. If it takes effort to read your text then a lot of people will just ignore it. Your text should be big enough that somebody watching your video on their smartphone screen – where everything is shrunk down – can read it easily.</p><p>It is easier to make your text larger when you stick to titles, keywords, and short sentences.</p><h4 id="3-Do-Not-Overuse"><a href="#3-Do-Not-Overuse" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Not Overuse"></a>3. Do Not Overuse</h4><p>Text is a great tool for making something stand out. However, if you try to use text to emphasize too much of what you say it will lose its effect. Text does not stand out anymore once viewers get too used to seeing it. Too much text can even get annoying and cause people to click away from your videos.</p><p>Try to use text to emphasize only the most important things you say.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none;
