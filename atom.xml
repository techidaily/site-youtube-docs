Now that you can allow access to camera and go through and select your videos, you can easily take advantage of the three convenient tools.</p><p>You can <strong>trim the beginning as well as the ending of the video</strong> quickly, and you can select new start as well as end points.

It’s all about flexing your creativity muscle and we are here to help you do it. Are you ready to be inspired? Great! Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983573">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983573">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983573%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983573/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings" class="headerlink" title="5.

Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136536/16384" target="_top" id="2136536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136536/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9. Be a Fan and a Critic</strong></h2><p><strong>Fanfiction:</strong> Continue a story of one of your favorite movie characters or explore the life of some secondary character in a television show that you enjoy. Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment" class="headerlink" title="10. Create Entertainment"></a><strong>10. Create Entertainment</strong></h2><p><strong>Fails:</strong> Don’t get embarrassed, get views. Embrace your shortcomings and accept that everybody has failed at something. Be careful and don’t get hurt too bad though.</p><p><strong>Parody:</strong> Channel your <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/barelypolitical" >Key of Awesome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your own parody of something from pop culture. If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop. Share your screen as you write a poem.</p><p><strong>Cinematography:</strong> There is always a place for beautiful cinematography on YouTube. Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary. Remember that when making a documentary, think about it as making a movie – you are not there to lecture them. Can you get people<a class="link"   href="http://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/michael-moores-13-rules-for-making-documentary-films-22384/" >riled up as Michael Moore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does? Can you encourage people to take action? If yes, then you are ready to start making documentary-style YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>Lip-sync:</strong> Can’t sing but feel you have a musical gift to give to the world, well, they will never put you on the billboards for what you can do lip-syncing, but you can make a pretty entertaining YouTube video through this medium. It doesn’t even have to be music either, take <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gneBUA39mnI" >Bad Lip Reading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Impressions:</strong> A good impression is always worth a good laugh, and a bad one is almost as good. Give it a shot, pull up videos of some of your favorite celebrities, and film yourself attempting to mimic their voice, characteristics and expressions.</p><p><strong>Sketch Comedy, Short Film, or Role Play:</strong> Do you have characters and scenes in mind that will be perfect for SNL? Well, instead of having to go through Lorne Michaels, create the character yourself and publish your comedy sketch on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Interview:</strong> Find a subject matter experts and ask them interesting questions about their profession and areas of interest.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> Play a game with your friends or other YouTubers and allow the competitiveness, frustration, and hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Okay! How do you feel?</p><p>I bet you are bursting and ready to create your next video. Onwards! Remember, whatever idea you pick, be sure to give it your own flair. That is what YouTube is all about.

The part 2 will tell you how to remove the videos from other YouTube channel.</p><hr><p> If you need more advanced features like PIP, Green Screen, or audio mixing, check this easy to use and powerful video editor-<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and ignite your video by clicks.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is YouTube Creative Commons and How to Use it &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-that-You’ve-Uploaded"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-that-You’ve-Uploaded" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Remove YouTube Videos that You’ve Uploaded"></a>Part 1: How to Remove YouTube Videos that You’ve Uploaded</h2><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Edit Uploaded YouTube Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The first thing that we are going to show you is how to remove your own videos. This might be needed if you have uploaded content quite some time ago and it is already outdated. Or, if you have too many videos on your channel and you need to clear up those who aren’t that interesting.</p><p> The fact of the matter is that it’s quite easy to remove YouTube videos. The first thing that you would need to do is going ahead and hop on the website and log into your account. Afterwards, you need to go to the “My Channel” option and click on the “Video Manager”.</p><p> Upon doing this, a new page is going to pop up, and you are going to see a list of all the videos that you’ve uploaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-youtube-video-basic-description-3.jpg"                      alt="Video list"                ></p><p> There are little tick boxes on the left side which you can click in order to mark. Mark the videos that you want to edit and click on the “Actions” button on top. There is going to be a drop-down menu, and you can click on the delete option to remove the video permanently. Furthermore, you can also hide the video if you don’t want to delete it but only to hide it away from your subscribers. In order to do so, you should simply click on the Private or Unlisted button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/how-to-remove-youtube-videos.jpg"                      alt="remove youtube videos"                ></p><p> That’s pretty much it – there’s nothing further to it, and the entire thing is rather comprehensive and easy to carry out, which makes it convenient to go through.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-YouTube-Videos-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels"></a>Part 2: How to Remove YouTube Videos on Other Channels</h2><p> Now that we’ve covered how to remove videos from your own channel, it’s time to dig a little bit deeper. There are certain instances in which you might want to remove YouTube videos from other channels as well. The reasons for this are usually rather personal. For instance – someone has uploaded a video including you or something yours without your consent, and this harms your reputation. Furthermore, it may display sensitive information that you don’t want to reveal to anyone else – the reasons are rather different, but they are related to your own individual privacy which is an important legal right.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Blur Faces in YouTube Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The first thing you can do is contact the person who uploaded the video and kindly asks him to remove it using the procedure that we described above. This is going to be the best choice because it’s going to achieve the result quickly and without any hassle. However, in certain cases, the person might not be active, or he might disagree with you and keep the video posted. If that’s the case, you have one option which is likely to be the best alternative.</p><p> You need to report the video as an inappropriate and flag it with the remark that it’s invading your privacy. This is going to lead you to the page of the YouTube Safety Center. You will have to explain the issue in details in a six-step wizard which extensively asks you about how the video is invasive to your privacy rights. The process is quite comprehensive, and it’s easy to go through. However, you will have to wait for the YouTube support team to assess it and make the decision for the removal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-youtube-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="remove other&#39;s youtube videos"                ></p><p> The truth is that being able to remove YouTube videos is something important that you should be able to do. It’s going to ensure that your channel is perfectly updated, aligned and structured while at the same time making sure that everything is in line with your privacy. YouTube is a powerful website, and you need to be able to stay in control in order to be protected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-effortless-way-to-personalize-your-youtube-channel-url-for-2024/"><u>[New] Effortless Way to Personalize Your YouTube Channel Url for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-craft-the-perfect-stream-a-comprehensive-guide-to-youtubes-full-rotation-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Craft the Perfect Stream A Comprehensive Guide to YouTube’s Full-Rotation Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-tailored-viewing-experience-constructing-a-personalized-watch-later-list/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tailored Viewing Experience Constructing a Personalized 'Watch Later' List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/aunch-your-youtube-presence-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[New] Launch Your YouTube Presence Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-illuminating-ideas-the-basics-of-video-setup/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Illuminating Ideas The Basics of Video Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-personalize-perfect-and-play-the-ultimate-guide-for-android-sound-choices/"><u>[Updated] Personalize, Perfect, and Play The Ultimate Guide for Android Sound Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/10-best-fake-gps-location-spoofers-for-realme-gt-neo-5-se-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>10 Best Fake GPS Location Spoofers for Realme GT Neo 5 SE | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-cheetah-dual-arms-for-tvs/"><u>Budget-Friendly Cheetah Dual Arms for TVs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/chaptered-cinema-on-vimeo-cutting-techniques-explained-for-2024/"><u>Chaptered Cinema on Vimeo Cutting Techniques Explained for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/craft-visionary-videos-from-start-to-finish-using-youtube-studio-editor-for-2024/"><u>Craft Visionary Videos From Start to Finish Using YouTube Studio Editor for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/free-download-focusrite-scarlett-2i2-audio-interface-software-for-pc/"><u>Free Download: Focusrite Scarlett 2I2 Audio Interface Software for PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-simulate-gps-movement-with-location-spoofer-on-xiaomi-redmi-a2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Xiaomi Redmi A2? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-6-best-sim-unlock-services-that-actually-work-on-your-samsung-galaxy-f04-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The 6 Best SIM Unlock Services That Actually Work On Your Samsung Galaxy F04 Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-the-definitive-guide-to-youtubes-algorithmic-secrets-for-rankings/"><u>In 2024, The Definitive Guide to YouTube's Algorithmic Secrets for Rankings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/akeaways-on-youtube-tv-an-overview-of-its-advantages-for-2024/"><u>Key Takeaways on YouTube TV An Overview of Its Advantages for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014857/22899" target="_top" id="2014857">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014857" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014857/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1.

Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p><p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p><p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life" class="headerlink" title="2.

Keep an eye on your: -</p><p>- Aesthetic</p><p>- Caption</p><p>- Filter</p><p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself.

Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page" class="headerlink" title="3.

Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss.

Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit"></a>1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p><p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The chances of being discovered on Reddit is much higher than on Twitter, as the upvote&#x2F;downvote system gives your good work a higher platform to stand on while lowering the bad content to Reddit’s cellar.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand the Reddiquettes"></a>3. Understand the Reddiquettes</h4><p>When engaging on Reddit, you must abide by rules which are called “reddiquette.” There are global reddiquettes and then there are individual community reddiquette.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"><strong>Global reddiquettes</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p>- Search for duplicate content before posting.</p><p>- Consume the content before voting.</p><p>- Act as you would in real life.</p><p>- And more.</p><h4 id="3-Community-reddiquettes"><a href="#3-Community-reddiquettes" class="headerlink" title="3. Community reddiquettes"></a>3. Community reddiquettes</h4><p>These are additional rules that the individual Reddit communities enforce. Be sure to read these rules before posting onto these specific communities. Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p><p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reddit-community-guideline-sample.jpg"                      alt="reddit community guideline sample"                ></p><p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p><p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p><h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely" class="headerlink" title="4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely"></a>4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p><p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there.

Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

People will subscribe when they feel invested in you as a person, and that happens when they feel like you are being sincere.

At the end of all your videos, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and like your social media page.</p><p>Don’t forget to explain the benefits of subscribing to them, such as to benefit from your informative tips and gain a deeper insight into your projects.

If people feel comfortable enough to leave you suggestions and requests then that is even better. It means that you have succeeded in making them feel like they are part of your community.</p><p>If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions.

A site called Gleam can oversee a contest for you. It’s up to you to choose how you want the contest to work, and you can gain an edge over your competitors by getting people to leave comments, follow you on Instagram, subscribe to your channel and more.</p><p>You will be provided with a landing page for promoting your channel, and you can share this in a variety of places, including on your Facebook, Twitter and blog. The best way to heighten your chances of success is to have a clear goal in mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-contest.JPG"                      alt="video0 contest"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-a-trailer"><a href="#3-Make-a-trailer" class="headerlink" title="3.

Make a trailer</h3><p>YouTube’s channel interface allows you to add a <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3031012/9-short-storytelling-tips-from-a-master-of-movie-trailers" >trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to entice viewers into watching your videos and following you on the platform. Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.</p><p>Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become. And here are some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best trailer makers that you can use on both Windows and Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-killer-youtube-channel-trailer.jpg"                      alt="trailer"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-and-Stick-To-It" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It"></a>4. Make a Schedule and Stick To It</h3><p>You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.</p><p>Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.</p><h3 id="5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers"><a href="#5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers"></a>5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers</h3><p>Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.</p><p>Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cooperation.JPG"                      alt="cooperation"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136612/26400" target="_top" id="2136612">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136612" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136612/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Get-Free-YouTube-Subscribers-6-Proven-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]"></a>Bonus: How to Get Free YouTube Subscribers [6 Proven Methods]</h2><p>There are lots of ways to get free YouTube subscribers. This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.</p><p>In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don’t need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.</p><h3 id="1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche"><a href="#1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche" class="headerlink" title="1. Find YouTubers in your niche"></a>1. Find YouTubers in your niche</h3><p>The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.</p><h3 id="2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like"><a href="#2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like" class="headerlink" title="2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like"></a>2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like</h3><p>Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.</p><p>It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel’s owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.</p><h3 id="3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day"><a href="#3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day" class="headerlink" title="3. Spend time watching videos each day"></a>3. Spend time watching videos each day</h3><p>Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.</p><p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p><h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return" class="headerlink" title="4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return"></a>4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p><p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p><h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p><p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137229/26400" target="_top" id="2137229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137229/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again" class="headerlink" title="6.

You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.</p><p>When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137205/26400" target="_top" id="2137205">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137205" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137205/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-step-by-step-guide-for-sharing-camera-roll-pictures-on-snapchat/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved A Step by Step Guide for Sharing Camera Roll Pictures on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unleashing-brand-potential-with-a-comprehensive-guide-to-smm-mastery/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unleashing Brand Potential with a Comprehensive Guide to SMM Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-how-to-embed-a-youtube-video-in-powerpoint/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Embed a YouTube Video in PowerPoint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-uncovered-wonders-top-6-stealthy-audio-capture-tools-androidios/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Uncovered Wonders Top 6 Stealthy Audio Capture Tools (Android/iOS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-blueprints-for-making-youtube-intro-videos-that-stick/"><u>[Updated] Blueprints for Making YouTube Intro Videos that Stick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-best-practices-choosing-youtubes-most-popular-video-formats/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Practices Choosing YouTube's Most Popular Video Formats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1-ultimate-guide-converting-audio-files-from-nsv-to-high-quality-mp4-step-by-step/"><u>1.

In the past, professional video equipment has been expensive and difficult to operate, but all of this has changed with the invention of digital cameras.</p><p> On the other hand, buying the most expensive microphones, lighting equipment or cameras doesn’t guarantee that your videos will be a major success once you post them on YouTube. Instead, you should look for the equipment that is best suited for the type of videos you want to create. Let’s explore the equipment that is necessary for running a successful YouTube channel.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Equipment-Will-You-Need-to-Start-Your-New-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#What-Equipment-Will-You-Need-to-Start-Your-New-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="What Equipment Will You Need to Start Your New YouTube Channel?"></a>What Equipment Will You Need to Start Your New YouTube Channel?</h2><p> The process of creating a video can be divided into three different stages, the pre-production, production, and post-production. Each stage has its own tools, without which completing a video would be impossible. In this article, we will be covering the equipment that will make the production stage of the process much smoother, and it will also help you to go through post-production much faster.</p><h3 id="Equipment-1-Camera"><a href="#Equipment-1-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Equipment 1: Camera"></a>Equipment 1: Camera</h3><p> You can’t shoot a video without a camera, but which camera you’re going to use depends on the type of the video you want to produce. Sometimes the camera that offers the most shooting options is not the best choice, and different factors like size or the weight of the camera can be much more important than the sheer quality of the footage.</p><h4 id="1-Cellphone-Cameras"><a href="#1-Cellphone-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="1.

Cellphone Cameras</h4><p> If you own a <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/mobile-video-editing/best-smartphones-for-recording-video.html" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you already have a camera you can use to create a YouTube video. Mobile phone cameras are easy to operate and they are perfect for shooting videos while you are on the go. However, most phones are incredibly light and holding the device in your hand while shooting may produce camera shakes that ruin the video. You’ll also need a third-party app in order to control all of the camera settings manually.</p><p> You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make YouTube videos with just your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, check this video for more details.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h4 id="2-Action-Cameras"><a href="#2-Action-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="2.

The GoPro and all similar types of cameras are small, lightweight, and they can produce videos in high resolution. Most of these cameras come with mounts and accessories that enable you to shoot perfectly stable footage while you are climbing, running or walking.</p><p> We have composed some useful tips and trick of buying and using action camera, in cast that you want to buy an action camera for shooting videos, do check out this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >ultimate action camera guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-Camcorders"><a href="#3-Camcorders" class="headerlink" title="3. Camcorders"></a>3. Camcorders</h4><p> YouTubers that often shoot videos on different locations, can hardly go wrong if they decide to capture their videos with a camcorder. The best models on the market enable you to shoot 4K videos, even in less than perfect light conditions and you can also adjust the camera settings manually. Camcorders are a great choice if you want to make sure that your footage always looks great, regardless of the location on which you recorded it.</p><p> If you want to buy a camcorder to shoot your YouTube vlog video, please do check this list of <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/4k/top-best-4k-camcorders.html" >best 4k camcorders that you can buy. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Mirrorless-Cameras"><a href="#4-Mirrorless-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="4. Mirrorless Cameras"></a>4. Mirrorless Cameras</h4><p> Besides offering superb image quality, mirrorless cameras also let you change lenses so you get the best shot in every scene you want to include in your video. These types of cameras are a popular choice for vlogging or capturing footage for all types of YouTube videos because they feature professional video recording options while remaining relatively lightweight and easy to carry around. However, the best mirrorless cameras on the market can be quite expensive, and you must be prepared to invest money in lenses and other equipment.</p><p> If you want to buy a mirrorless camera to shoot your YouTube vlog video, please do check this list of <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/4k/best-4k-mirrorless-camera.html" >best 4k mirrorless cameras. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-DSLR-Cameras"><a href="#5-DSLR-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="5. DSLR Cameras"></a>5. DSLR Cameras</h4><p> Seasoned professionals, as well as the newcomers to the world of video production, can benefit from using a DSLR camera for shooting the content for their YouTube channel. These types of cameras allow you to change lenses, pull focus manually, shoot at different frame rates or capture the footage in 4K and Full HD quality. What’s more, you can use a DSLR camera even in challenging light conditions, because most models support ISO sensitivity values that enable the camera to produce remarkable image quality even when the amount of light in a shot is far from perfect.</p><p> With a DSLR camera, you can also use it a webcam for recording your face and your desktop screen at the same time, check <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/webcam-recording/use-dslr-camera-as-webcam.html" >how to use a DSLR camera as a webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Equipment-2-Microphones"><a href="#Equipment-2-Microphones" class="headerlink" title="Equipment 2: Microphones"></a>Equipment 2: Microphones</h3><p> Moving images are less effective without sound, which is the reason why you should pay close attention to this aspect of the video making process. All cameras have built-in microphones, but the audio quality they produce is often not good enough to actually use it in a YouTube video. That’s why recording sound with an external microphone is a common practice among the most successful YouTubers.</p><p> The location at which you’re shooting the video will help you determine which microphone you should use for that project. If you are recording your YouTube video in the exterior an omnidirectional microphone is your best choice because it will eliminate the wind noise. Furthermore, as their name suggests these microphones can pick up sounds from all directions so people in your videos don’t have to speak directly into the microphone.</p><p> Shotgun or unidirectional mics are frequently used in studio conditions when you want to eliminate all other sounds except the narrator’s voice. Gamers, tutorial makers and all other YouTube content creators that rely heavily on narration in their videos use shotgun mics because they produce great audio quality. Even though it is easy to overlook the importance of sound for the overall quality of the video you’re working on, a video with great audio quality may actually help you attract more followers on YouTube.</p><p> Check: <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-microphone-for-youtuber-videos.html" >best microphones for YouTube vloggers. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Equipment-3-Video-Stabilization-Equipment"><a href="#Equipment-3-Video-Stabilization-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Equipment 3: Video Stabilization Equipment"></a>Equipment 3: Video Stabilization Equipment</h3><p> Holding a camera in your hand while shooting a video is often not the best idea, because even breathing may cause the camera to move and produce camera shakes. That’s where <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tripods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, steadicams, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >gimbals <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, rigs and other video stabilization equipment comes in. As a matter of fact, you should only shoot handheld videos when you want to achieve this effect, while all another camera movement should be avoided without the use of appropriate equipment.</p><p> Shaky videos are not very pleasant to watch and they can reduce your chances of attracting more followers on YouTube. The video stabilization equipment offers a great solution, and you can get a professional tripod or gimbal at a very reasonable price. However, which video stabilization equipment you are going to use depends on the camera you have and the type of shot you want to get.</p><p> Check our list of <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-camera-stabilizers-for-youtube.html" >best camera stabilizer for YouTubers in 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139557/4704" target="_top" id="2139557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139557/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Equipment-4-Lighting-Equipment"><a href="#Equipment-4-Lighting-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Equipment 4: Lighting Equipment"></a>Equipment 4: Lighting Equipment</h3><p> Instead of struggling with natural light sources and having to deal with shadows, you can simply use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >lighting equipment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to equalize the light values in a shot. Of course, whether or not you will use artificial light in your video depends on a number of factors, including the location and the visual style you’re trying to achieve.</p><p> Whether you will use an on-camera LED light, ring light or softbox video lights is yet another creative decision you will have to make during the process of shooting your YouTube video. The great majority of video lighting equipment produces the best results in controlled, studio-like conditions, so before you go ahead and buy an on-camera light or a softbox make sure that you know how the equipment will perform on the interior and exterior locations.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Producing YouTube videos on a constant basis requires you to have the right equipment for the job. You don’t have to shoot your videos with the most expensive camera out there or have the best microphone on the market in order to create a great YouTube video, but having the equipment capable of delivering a professional level of video and audio quality won’t hurt your chances of becoming a successful YouTuber.</p><p> We’d love to hear all about the gear you’re using to capture your videos, so leave a comment and let us know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/argain-microphones-for-youtube-creators-starting-small/"><u>[New] Bargain Microphones for YouTube Creators Starting Small</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/lite-influencer-economy-leaders/"><u>[New] Elite Influencer Economy Leaders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ape-looper-mastery-app-for-2024/"><u>[New] Tape Looper Mastery App for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-maximize-views-with-these-top-20-thumbnail-fonts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximize Views with These Top 20 Thumbnail Fonts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-elite-recording-tools-for-gamers/"><u>[Updated] Elite Recording Tools for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-enlightenment-streams-foremost-ed-resources-online/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Enlightenment Streams Foremost Ed Resources Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/apply-these-techniques-to-improve-how-to-detect-fake-gps-location-on-honor-80-pro-straight-screen-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Apply These Techniques to Improve How to Detect Fake GPS Location On Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/elevate-meeting-aesthetics-how-to-add-filters-on-zoom/"><u>Elevate Meeting Aesthetics How to Add Filters on Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/elevate-your-esports-experience-with-the-best-bluetooth-gaming-headsets-of-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Esports Experience with the Best Bluetooth Gaming Headsets of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/gopro-hero5-premium-showdown-black-edition/"><u>GoPro Hero5 Premium Showdown Black Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/how-to-overcome-the-cannot-display-webpage-hurdle-on-ie/"><u>How to Overcome the ‘Cannot Display Webpage’ Hurdle on IE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/hp-officejet-4650-driver-software-for-windows-installation-guide-and-download/"><u>HP OfficeJet 4650 Driver Software for Windows - Installation Guide & Download</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/24-why-youtube-tv-is-a-game-changer-in-streaming/"><u>In 2024, Why YouTube TV Is a Game-Changer in Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/srt-conversion-essentials-ttml-xml-ssa-and-beyond-for-2024/"><u>SRT Conversion Essentials TTML, XML, SSA, and Beyond for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-singing-machine-sml3singing-machine-review-plug-and-play-perfection/"><u>The Complete Guide to the Singing Machine SML3^[Singing Machine] Review - Plug and Play Perfection!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A teacher should start a YouTube channel because it is beneficial to their students and themselves. The materials or content dished on these channels helps give lessons and instructions in the absence of the teacher, give a detailed explanation and trigger the students’ interest.</p><p>Also, it archives all the lessons for a long time and makes them easily accessible by both the present, past, and future students. Students can quickly go back for a review for upcoming exams. Through feedbacks or comments, teachers can provide answers to students with the problem of clarity.</p><p>A teacher needs to know what an educational video is, what makes an excellent educational video, and <strong>how to make an educational video for YouTube</strong> before opening a YouTube channel. Now, let’s delve into it!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-an-Educational-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-an-Educational-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What’s an Educational Video?"></a>Part 1. What’s an Educational Video?</h2><p>From the name “educational video,” you can coin out that it is a video made for the sole purpose of educating or passing out knowledge for the sake of learning. The primary purpose of these videos is to teach an audience about a particular problem or important topics they want to learn about.</p><p>Sometimes brands use this method to advertise their brand while being a source of information.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Makes-a-Good-Educational-Video"><a href="#Part-2-What-Makes-a-Good-Educational-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Makes a Good Educational Video?"></a>Part 2. What Makes a Good Educational Video?</h2><p>An excellent educational video aids the learning process. It triggers learners in analyzing and evaluating concepts provided by the video. Videos are great educational tools that most teachers must adopt due to their role in facilitating the learning process.</p><p>To make a good educational video, you should keep the following points in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep your students engaged</strong></li></ul><p>An excellent educational video should be eye catchy and exciting to get your student’s undivided attention. You can achieve it in any way, one of which is that you need to put yourself into the teaching mode, which means that you should give out the impression of your excitement for the course content you are talking about. Ask them questions, let them feel involved in the process. Please don’t go ahead talking with a cold tune. It makes them tired of listening or seeing the video.</p><ul><li><strong>Be sure to maintain a right-size of video length</strong></li></ul><p>It’s better shorter than longer. Have you ever seen a boring, long movie? It’s almost the same feeling you get seeing a long educational video.</p><p>The video should be straightforward to leverage the advantage of this form of learning. One needs to make this video of the right size for easy assimilation by the learner. Depending on the course topic, your video can be between <strong>2 - 20 minutes</strong> long.</p><p>Most importantly, don’t try to do much and use more straightforward, understandable concepts.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay focused</strong></li></ul><p>Making your videos focused and not running around many things helps it pass the information that plays a good role in video length management and engagement. Videos that try to divert from the topic may end up not hitting the nail on the head and not accomplishing their purpose.</p><ul><li><strong>Center your interest on the student’s needs</strong></li></ul><p>Any educational content should be centered to meet the needs of the students. That goes beyond creating content, but covers the entirety of satisfying the needs of your learners.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Great-Educational-Video-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Great-Educational-Video-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The attention span of an average person who watches videos online is rather limited, which means that you, as a YouTube video creator, have only a small window of opportunity to captivate their attention. A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.</p><h2 id="The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos"></a>The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/learn-gaming-video-editing-skills-banner.png" >Wondershare Filmstock Gaming Video Editing Skils <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source_channel=seo_article&spm=rs.filmora_web" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle&amp;spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="1-Panzoid"><a href="#1-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="1.

Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.</p><h4 id="2-Blender"><a href="#2-Blender" class="headerlink" title="2. Blender"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, Windows, macOS</p><p>Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender. This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.</p><h4 id="3-Renderforest"><a href="#3-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="3. Renderforest"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.renderforest.com/" >Renderforest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.</p><h4 id="4-MotionDen"><a href="#4-MotionDen" class="headerlink" title="4. MotionDen"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://motionden.com/" >MotionDen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,00</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy. There are hundreds of templates organized in categories and you just have to go to YouTube Intros category and select the intro you’d like to add to your YouTube video. You must create an account on the MotionDen platform, if you want to customize your videos before you download them. Keep in mind that you can only edit and download one intro for free and that you must choose a subscription plan in order to be able to fully customize the 3D YouTube intro you’ve selected and download it to your computer without a watermark. MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.</p><h4 id="5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube"><a href="#5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="5.

There are over 4000 free intro templates to choose from that are organized around themes such as Game, Nature City or Timelapse and there are a number of styles available so you can try out 3D or Glitch intros. The app also features more than a hundred royalty-free songs, as well as a diverse collection of sound effects you can add to the intros you customize. The app’s text editing capabilities are remarkable since you can animate the text with twenty different animations, change a font or control the shadows.

Do a Skit"></a>1. Do a Skit</h4><p>YouTube is the perfect medium for short, generally between one and ten minutes long comedy sketches. The majority of the audience on YouTube isn’t patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).</p><p>Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it’s short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.</p><h4 id="2-Start-a-Funny-Series"><a href="#2-Start-a-Funny-Series" class="headerlink" title="2. Start a Funny Series"></a>2. Start a Funny Series</h4><p>Try producing a pilot episode of a comedy series for your YouTube channel. Don’t worry about the budget too much because if your ideas are good even a DIY approach will be enough.</p><p>Producing a funny series requires dedication and commitment to that goal, so don’t let yourself be discouraged easily.</p><h4 id="3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos"><a href="#3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos"></a>3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</h4><p>Posting cute videos on your YouTube channel will certainly help you get attention online. The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.</p><p>It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won’t get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.</p><h4 id="4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits"><a href="#4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits" class="headerlink" title="4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits"></a>4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits</h4><p>The term machinima means creating a cinematic production by re-using material from video games. Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.</p><p>The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.</p><h4 id="5-Parody-Video"><a href="#5-Parody-Video" class="headerlink" title="5. Parody Video"></a>5. Parody Video</h4><p>A well done, poignant parody never fails to make people laugh. Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.</p><p>Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.</p><h4 id="6-Bloopers"><a href="#6-Bloopers" class="headerlink" title="6. Bloopers"></a>6. Bloopers</h4><p>We all make mistakes. Blooper videos enable us to at least laugh at them. Experienced YouTubers know how easy it is to flub a take, but it takes a brave creator to make an entire video from the shots they messed up.</p><h4 id="7-Lip-Sync-Video"><a href="#7-Lip-Sync-Video" class="headerlink" title="7. Lip-Sync Video"></a>7. Lip-Sync Video</h4><p>Have you ever imagined what it’s like to be a pop star? Lip-sync videos offer the opportunity to step into someone else’s shoes for a moment and have fun with it. Knowing the song you’re lip-syncing and having good timing can help, but you can hardly go wrong producing a video of yourself pouring your soul into a song you’re lip-syncing.</p><p>Lip-syncing to tunes from the most popular stars in the world will enable you to gain traffic from people looking for content related to those songs and artists.</p><p>Need more YouTube video ideas?

Do you want to learn how to make your own?</p><p>A little while ago, we posted a list of YouTube channels where you could <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >get free green screen effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. All of these effects consisted of animations on green backgrounds. To use them, you pull the clip into the PIP track of your Filmora project and use the green screen feature to make the background transparent. It’s pretty easy.</p><p>In this post, we’re going to kick things up a bit. Here is a list of places where you can get free lessons on creating your own animated video effects.</p><p><strong>Animated Video Effect Courses:</strong></p><p><a href="#mtmograph">Mt.

The focus is more on animating figures&#x2F;cartoons than video effects, but if you have any interest in animation more generally then this is a great place to start learning. They even have a free ebook you can download which is targeted at beginners.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1936838">                    <video width="374" height="48" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1936838">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:234px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcoinrule.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1936838%2F18409'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1936838/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-Copilot"><a href="#Video-Copilot" class="headerlink" title="** Video Copilot"></a>** Video Copilot</h2><p>This site has a huge number of free After Effects tutorials.
