### 9. [PicMonkey](https://www.picmonkey.com/)

PicMonkey was once a free online design tool but now you’ll have to pay for it. You’re definitely getting a lot more with this paid online design tool. Unlike most of the online design tools that we have previously mentioned, in PicMonkey, you can toggle between layers like you can in PhotoShop, select from a variety of blending options, and you also have the ability to draw and erase. In this entire list, it’s the closest tool you’ll get to PhotoShop.

### 10. [Adobe PhotoShop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

Last and definitely not the least on our list is Adobe PhotoShop, professional design software that you will have to install onto your computer. You can design your own channel art from scratch or customize pre-made templates to fit your brand.
