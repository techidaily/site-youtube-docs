![ways for youtube monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Maximizing-Revenue-How-to-monetize-YouTube-Channel-on-Mobile-in-2023-6.JPG)

### Ads on YouTube

Monetizing a website has many methods, but this is the most basic and straightforward one. Various YouTube ad formats provide control over ad placement before or during a video.

### Sponsorships that are paid
