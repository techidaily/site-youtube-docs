**1\. Evan S' Story**

Wondershare Filmora is an all-around amazing video editor, and that's why I have been using it for over 3 years. My favorable features in Filmora would be Keyframing and Motion Tracking. I became a Filmora Partner in December 2020 - and I’m glad that I did. The opportunity that Filmora offered me to share my videos with more people and grow my channel was amazing, I knew I couldn't pass on this amazing opportunity. And so, it began! I started making my Filmora videos, and I was proudly saying in each one that I’m a Filmora Partner. The Filmora team was also very friendly and nice, giving me a lot of support and creative freedom in the videos I was creating.

**2\. Sikander Kumar's Story**

When I uploaded my first Filmora tutorial video on YouTube, I never thought that one day, I will get an opportunity to work with the Wondershare Team. The day I got an email from the team, my mind was blown away, as for me it was idealistic. So, without any hesitation, I accepted the partnership program in December 2020, and the way it has worked was very smooth. Working with the Wondershare Filmora team was one of the best experiences that I had till now. The most attractive thing about the product is that it doesn't require any high maintenance system specifications and can be used in almost every system. Filmora has very good compatibility in this regard.

**3\. Mohammad Khan's Story**

I'm using Filmora for editing my YouTube videos for almost 2 years now. In my experience, Filmora is great for beginners, and it is quite easy to use. I would recommend it to people who are new to video editing and want to use advanced editing features. Filmora helped me make compelling and professional videos with just a few clicks. The Filmora team regularly updated the tool with new features according to the ongoing trends. I joined the partnership program back in December 2020\. I love to share my knowledge with others on YouTube by making tutorials video on Filmora video editor so that others can also make professional videos with it.
