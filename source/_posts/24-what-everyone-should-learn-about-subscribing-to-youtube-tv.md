## What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?

YouTube TV, in a nutshell, is a live TV streaming service available in the United States. It's an Internet-based replacement for cable or satellite television that works on phones, tablets, TVs, and web browsers, allowing you to watch TV, in the same manner you always have from anywhere you have an internet connection, whether at home or on the road.

When it first started in 2017, YouTube TV was limited to a small number of areas in the United States. That changed in 2019 when a significant expansion included support for all 210 markets. It has also substantially grown its channel library throughout the years. There are currently over 85 stations available on YouTube TV, including four major national broadcasters: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.

Despite its name, YouTube TV is not a part of YouTube; Google maintains both as different companies. However, there are some instances where the two overlap, such as with YouTube Originals, which essentially means that you may end up viewing a few series on both platforms. Nonetheless, YouTube TV is not the same as YouTube, and you'll need two apps on your streaming device to access both.

YouTube TV has a distinctive set of features that make it incredibly enticing — so much so that it is comfortably among the top three live TV providers in the United States in terms of paid subscribers. This is due to a variety of circumstances. YouTube TV is simple to use. It has a channel lineup that is competitive with all of the others.

In addition, the YouTube TV price is reasonable. You can watch YouTube TV on almost any current gadget. And the fact that parent company Alphabet (aka Google) has been heavily marketing it over the last few years hasn't hurt either.

A lot is going on with YouTube TV, and it's only gotten better with time.

## What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?

YouTube TV, in a nutshell, is a live TV streaming service available in the United States. It's an Internet-based replacement for cable or satellite television that works on phones, tablets, TVs, and web browsers, allowing you to watch TV, in the same manner you always have from anywhere you have an internet connection, whether at home or on the road.

When it first started in 2017, YouTube TV was limited to a small number of areas in the United States. That changed in 2019 when a significant expansion included support for all 210 markets. It has also substantially grown its channel library throughout the years. There are currently over 85 stations available on YouTube TV, including four major national broadcasters: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.

Despite its name, YouTube TV is not a part of YouTube; Google maintains both as different companies. However, there are some instances where the two overlap, such as with YouTube Originals, which essentially means that you may end up viewing a few series on both platforms. Nonetheless, YouTube TV is not the same as YouTube, and you'll need two apps on your streaming device to access both.
