## Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags

Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.

If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.

This is a list that might help:

* #vloggingmylife
* #vlogginggear
* #vloggerlife
* #vloggers
* #vloglife
* #vlogger
* #vlogging
* #youtuber
* #vlogs
* #dailyvlog
* #vloggingcamera
* #vloging
* #vloggingcommunity
* #vloggerlifestyle
* #travelvlogging
* #vloggingmum
* #foodvlogging
* #vlogginglife
* #newtovlogging
* #disneyvlogging
* #vlogging101
* #vloggingsetup
* #vloggingfamily
* #vlogday
* #kidsvlogging
* #imvlogginghere
* #beautyvlogging
* #microvlogging
* #motovlogging
* #instavlogging

When using hashtags for YouTube, it's essential to put yourself in your viewers' shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.

For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.

This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.

## Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags

You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.

The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It's a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.

Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:

### 1 Keyword Tool

This tool's primary purpose may be to help with keyword research, but it has a valuable hashtag extension.

First, type in the topic of your video. For example, "vlog." Hit Search.

![youtube hashtag generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg)

Then, select the Hashtags panel.

![youtube hashtag tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg)

This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.

![list of tags for youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg)

That's all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time. The choice is yours.

### 2 TubeBuddy Chrome Extension

![tubebuddy chrome extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/tubebuddy.jpg)

TubeBuddy is a Chrome extension that does much more for your YouTube channel than help with hashtags. It's an optimization tool that will configure everything for better reach.

It's also available as an Android and iOS app. As for the Chrome extension, you install it, and it integrates with YouTube.

The next time you upload a video, it will analyze it and help you process and publish it more quickly.

Additionally, TubeBuddy will also show you the best possible hashtags to use for your unique video. Over 1 million people use it. That should be proof enough that this tool truly offers something valuable.

### 3 VidIQ Chrome Extension

![vidlq chrome extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/vidlq.jpg)

This is another Chrome extension that helps you find keywords and YouTube tags to get more views. It's just as easy to use as the previous one. VidLQ has over 2 million users worldwide, proving its usefulness.

Plus, it has plenty of other features to help you grow your channel. For example, its Competitors Tool will give you insights into what similar channels are doing. VidLQ will also help you optimize your videos to get recommended to more viewers. As we all know, this can significantly increase your views.

It's a great tool that can be especially beneficial for beginners. However, because of its simplicity, anyone starting on Youtube should use it. It does most of the publishing for you but teaches you how to do it yourself.
