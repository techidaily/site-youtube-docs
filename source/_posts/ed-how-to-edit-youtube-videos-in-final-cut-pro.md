## How to Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro

In this section, we are going to take a quick look at the steps that you need to take in order to properly edit YouTube videos in Final Cut Pro. Without any further ado, let's take a look.

#### Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP

This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you've left it over from some past event that's long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it's a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it's not highlighted or you aren't able to select it, the software doesn't support it, and it's not compatible.

Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.

#### Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro

That's the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.

* First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.

* Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on **Balance Color** and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.

* You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.

#### Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly

This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -> Share -> Master File -> Setting -> File -> Share -> YouTube. That's basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -> Publish and the entire thing is done. That's all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.
