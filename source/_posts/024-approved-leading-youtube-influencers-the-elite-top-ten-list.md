## The Ultimate Checklist for Becoming a Youtuber

#### \- Make A Decision on Your Niche

For example, a fitness YouTuber would make videos about workouts and a healthy diet.

What do you want to achieve with your YouTube channel? Do you want to make instructive videos to help others? Do you want to create how-to videos and tutorials to show others how to do things?

#### \- Come Up with Content Ideas

\- Make A Content Calendar

#### It will be easier to maintain consistency if you have a regular schedule. It assures your subscribers that new videos will be released on the scheduled dates. It also includes a thorough timeline that you can use to plan your activities and keep on track
