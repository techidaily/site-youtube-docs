### Tip 1\. Set your target audience

There are different levels of yoga practitioners as well as their lifestyle.

### Tip 4\. Rank on SEO

### Tip 1\. Set your target audience

There are different levels of yoga practitioners as well as their lifestyle. A working mom may give you 10 minutes from her morning routine while a college-going student can give you 10 minutes in the afternoon. Hence, first you need to set your target audience and create your content based on that.
