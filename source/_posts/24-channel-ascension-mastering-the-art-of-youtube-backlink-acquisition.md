## How Can I Get YouTube Backlinks for My Videos?

Getting high-quality backlinks can be challenging if you don't know how to do it. The good news is that there are many different methods that you can use to get links that will benefit your YouTube videos; all it takes is a little creativity.

With that in mind, here are some of the safest ways of getting YouTube backlinks for free for your videos.

#### Guest Vlogging

![Build YouTube Backlink with Guest Vlogging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-1.png)

If you have a large social media following or even just a few loyal subscribers on YouTube, consider using that to your advantage. Many bloggers and popular vloggers will allow guest appearances in their videos — as long as they also get something out of it. If you are a vlogger in a specific niche, you could guest vlog for someone well-known in your niche, or anyone with higher ranking videos than yours.

#### Share Your Videos on Social Media

![Share your youtube video on social media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-2.png)

Posting original content on social media sites is also a great way to get high-quality backlinks for free. People will click your links, and this can help you to get more views and subscribers too. Many bloggers and vloggers often post the videos they feature on their social media platforms.

#### Web 2.0 Sites

![get youtube backlink via web 2.0 sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-3.png)

The use of Web 2.0 sites is a great way to get backlinks for your YouTube videos. Web 2.0 sites, such as Squarespace, Blogger, Blog, Weebly, and WordPress allow you to embed your videos. You can post original content on these sites, which will then link back to yours. So this makes them powerful links indeed.

Incorporate such websites into your marketing strategy and then target your keywords correctly to get more user engagement. In turn, both your site and embedded video will rank on the top page of search engines, meaning you will rank for that particular search query.

#### Pinterest Video Pins

![use pinterest video pins to get backlink](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-4.png)

Pinterest video pins are another great option. They are simply a link to your YouTube video placed on the Pinterest site. With over 320 million monthly active users and more than 200 billion pins saved, this is a great way to get YouTube backlinks for free. It also helps you grow your following.

Creating backlinks using Pinterest video pins can help you tell a story about your brand, idea, or project. Video pins attract and grab the attention of your audience using a cover image. What's more? You can create video adverts to advertise on Pinterest.

#### Unlinked Mentions

![unlinked mentiosn for youtube backlinks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-5.png)

The use of unlinked mentions means that whenever someone writes about a YouTube video without linking it back, you provide them with a link yourself; this is a great way to obtain YouTube backlinks for free.

**●** Questions: Is it safe to buy YouTube backlinks?

**●** No, it is not. You should not buy backlinks because it's against Google's Webmaster Guidelines. If you get caught, you will get a Google penalty for trying to cheat the system.

03 [How Can I Get YouTube Backlinks for My Videos?](#Part 3)

04 [A Few More SEO Factors for YouTube SEO](#Part 4)

## What Are YouTube Backlinks?

Links between other sites to your YouTube videos are referred to as YouTube backlinks. Backlinks are crucial to growing traffic, increasing discovery speed, and improving ranks. Backlinks are almost akin to a site's reputation as they can act as a vote of confidence for the quality of your videos.

The content of a video with more backlinks is seen as more valuable by search engines than those with less, as each backlink adds confidence that the video is worth linking to.

The popularity of the sites linking to a YouTube video also plays a part as they naturally lead to increased traffic coming to sites through backlinks. Search engines often check popular videos for new backlinks leading to the quick discovery of new content.

The quality of backlinks significantly impacts the ranking and visibility of a given video. Search engines consider links from relevant sources as more valuable as people are more likely to click them.

Lastly, placement and formatting of links play a part as a link that stands out is more likely to generate traffic than one that doesn’t.

## Are YouTube Backlinks Important?

Yes. Backlinks are one of the vital aspects of SEO. They are essential to ranking well in Google search results, and they also help you stay ahead of your competition.

Backlinks act as a powerful source to attract your target audience. While getting people to your might be challenging, sending them to your other work is a breeze. You only have to include YouTube backlinks for free to do so. With 65% of people being visual learners, YouTube is a resourceful place for using backlinks.

## How Can I Get YouTube Backlinks for My Videos?

Getting high-quality backlinks can be challenging if you don't know how to do it. The good news is that there are many different methods that you can use to get links that will benefit your YouTube videos; all it takes is a little creativity.

With that in mind, here are some of the safest ways of getting YouTube backlinks for free for your videos.

#### Guest Vlogging

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Build YouTube Backlink with Guest Vlogging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-1.png)

If you have a large social media following or even just a few loyal subscribers on YouTube, consider using that to your advantage. Many bloggers and popular vloggers will allow guest appearances in their videos — as long as they also get something out of it. If you are a vlogger in a specific niche, you could guest vlog for someone well-known in your niche, or anyone with higher ranking videos than yours.

#### Share Your Videos on Social Media

![Share your youtube video on social media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-2.png)

Posting original content on social media sites is also a great way to get high-quality backlinks for free. People will click your links, and this can help you to get more views and subscribers too. Many bloggers and vloggers often post the videos they feature on their social media platforms.

#### Web 2.0 Sites

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![get youtube backlink via web 2.0 sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-3.png)

The use of Web 2.0 sites is a great way to get backlinks for your YouTube videos. Web 2.0 sites, such as Squarespace, Blogger, Blog, Weebly, and WordPress allow you to embed your videos. You can post original content on these sites, which will then link back to yours. So this makes them powerful links indeed.

Incorporate such websites into your marketing strategy and then target your keywords correctly to get more user engagement. In turn, both your site and embedded video will rank on the top page of search engines, meaning you will rank for that particular search query.

#### Pinterest Video Pins

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![use pinterest video pins to get backlink](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-4.png)

Pinterest video pins are another great option. They are simply a link to your YouTube video placed on the Pinterest site. With over 320 million monthly active users and more than 200 billion pins saved, this is a great way to get YouTube backlinks for free. It also helps you grow your following.

Creating backlinks using Pinterest video pins can help you tell a story about your brand, idea, or project. Video pins attract and grab the attention of your audience using a cover image. What's more? You can create video adverts to advertise on Pinterest.

#### Unlinked Mentions

![unlinked mentiosn for youtube backlinks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-backlinks-5.png)

The use of unlinked mentions means that whenever someone writes about a YouTube video without linking it back, you provide them with a link yourself; this is a great way to obtain YouTube backlinks for free.

**●** Questions: Is it safe to buy YouTube backlinks?

**●** No, it is not. You should not buy backlinks because it's against Google's Webmaster Guidelines. If you get caught, you will get a Google penalty for trying to cheat the system.
