![add subscribe watermark filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-t-series-income-on-youtube-10.jpg)

Step5 Change the position where the Subscribe watermark should appear in your video. Then, play the video to preview it.

Step6 After you’re done with the editing, click the Export button from the top bar and choose Burn DVD from the drop-down list that shows up.

If you’re looking to start your YouTube journey and be like T-Series some days, you should start now. The first move you should make is to invest in Wondershare Filmora software, as it has lots of tools to offer for editing videos with high quality.
