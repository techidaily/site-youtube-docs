First impressions matter, in real life and in the world of online content production. The attention span of an average person who watches videos online is rather limited, which means that you, as a YouTube video creator, have only a small window of opportunity to captivate their attention. A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.

## The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos

Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.

#### 1. Panzoid

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This is an online platform that features hundreds of templates created by the platform’s users. Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.

#### 2. Blender

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Linux, Windows, macOS

Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender. This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.

#### 3. Renderforest

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export

**Compatibility:** web-based

You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.

#### 4. MotionDen

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $9,00

**Compatibility:** web-based

Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy. There are hundreds of templates organized in categories and you just have to go to YouTube Intros category and select the intro you’d like to add to your YouTube video. You must create an account on the MotionDen platform, if you want to customize your videos before you download them. Keep in mind that you can only edit and download one intro for free and that you must choose a subscription plan in order to be able to fully customize the 3D YouTube intro you’ve selected and download it to your computer without a watermark. MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.

#### 5. Intro Maker for YouTube

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android

If you choose to install the Intro Maker for YouTube app on your phone you will be able to create intros for your YouTube videos in just a couple of minutes. There are over 4000 free intro templates to choose from that are organized around themes such as Game, Nature City or Timelapse and there are a number of styles available so you can try out 3D or Glitch intros. The app also features more than a hundred royalty-free songs, as well as a diverse collection of sound effects you can add to the intros you customize. The app’s text editing capabilities are remarkable since you can animate the text with twenty different animations, change a font or control the shadows. The only downside is that you are going to have to make in-app purchases if you want to unlock all the features the app has to offer.
