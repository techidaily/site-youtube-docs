#### 3.VLC Media Player \[Windows & Mac & Linux, Free\]

![screen recorder vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-VLC.JPG)

VLC Media Player is a free media player that has a great screen recording feature. You can download it from Video LAN.org. In order to take a screen recording using VLC you first need to click on View and Advanced Controls. A lot of the more advanced features, like screen recording, are initially hidden so as not to confuse users, but selecting Advanced Controls will make them visible. Then you can go to Media and Open Capture Device. In the window that opens choose Desktop next to Capture Mode and click Play. VLC will start displaying your desktop in the player window. Now you just have to click Record.

#### 4.QuickTime \[Mac, Free\]

![screen recorder quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-QuickTime.JPG)

QuickTime is the default media player for Mac users. To access QuickTime’s screen recording feature select File and New Screen Recording. In the window that pops up click on the arrow next to the Record button and choose a microphone. Then you can press Record. Your recording will not start right away. First, a window will pop up explaining that you can stop your recording by pressing ‘command-control-escape’. Although QuickTime is available for PCs the PC version does not have a screen recording feature.

#### 1. AZ Screen Recorder

![AZ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-AZ.JPG)

AZ Screen Recorder is free screen recording app for Android 5.0 Lollipop. Using AZ Screen Recorder you can simultaneously record from your phone’s camera and screen. This is useful if you want to shoot a video of yourself explaining an app to add into your final video. Although the basic version of AZ Screen Recorder is free there are in-app purchases.

#### 2.Unlimited Screen Recorder

![unlimited](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-Unlimited.JPG)

Unlimited Screen Recorder is also for 5.0 Lollipop and is free with in-app purchases. Like the name ‘Unlimited’ suggests you can use this app to record for as long as you want. There is no time limit. You can also record audio through Unlimited Screen Recorder so it is convenient to make a voiceover for your video.

There are very few options available for recording Android devices older than Lollipop without rooting your device.

If your iOS is above 11 (including 11) version, you can record the screen with its in-app application, check this video to know the details:

Apart from recording with the built-in recording tool, you can also use some best iOS screen recording apps to record YouTube videos, or use some mirror software to record iPhone/iPad on Windows and Mac and create a YouTube video.

#### 1.QuickTime

![quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-QuickTimeiOS.JPG)

QuickTime can be used to record the screen of your iPhone or iPad in addition to the screen of your Mac. First you need to connect your device to your computer with a USB port. Instead of selecting ‘New Screen Recording’ in QuickTime, the way you would when recording your computer screen, select ‘New Movie Recording’. In the recording window click on the arrow next to the ‘Record’ button and choose your iOS device where it asks you to choose a camera. This method only works with the Mac version of QuickTime.

#### 2.Reflector

![reflector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-recorder-Reflector.JPG)

Reflector is mirroring software available for Mac or PC. Mirroring software creates a clone of your device’s interface on your computer screen. Once your device is being displayed on the screen of your computer you can capture it by recording your computer screen. You can download Reflector from Airsquirrels.com.

In order to use Reflector to mirror your device, you will also need to use AirPlay on your iPhone or iPad, and your device and your computer will need to be connected to the same wifi network. In AirPlay, make sure mirroring is on and select your computer as a receiver. Your computer will not show up as an option if you do not have Reflector running.
