YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.

## Details On Youtube Music

YouTube recently added 'YouTube Music' to assist advertise the website as a music-focused destination. You don't have to stay on the page for the music to keep playing, and there are no adverts if you pay for this service. Despite this, YouTube is still working to make its website more musical. The beauty of this is that even if you don't want to pay, you still have access to all of YouTube's music.

Using platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to distribute your music is a terrific way to get it out there. However, when compared to YouTube, there are several drawbacks. For starters, they are both expensive.

Even though this is critical for compensating artists, it already restricts the audience's reach. Second, because there are so many music platforms to choose from, audiences are likely to have a favorite, which could mean they don't have access to the platform you use to release your music. On the other hand, YouTube doesn't have any of these problems.

YouTube's other services are also free, making them accessible to everybody regardless of their financial position. This implies that you can access the site as long as you have a phone or a laptop. Many well-known musicians began their careers on YouTube. It provides a free platform for you to advertise yourself, regardless of your present level of popularity. Even some of the most popular profiles are musician accounts, demonstrating the site's potential for musical promotion.

## Why Is It Necessary To Upload Longer Videos And Music To Youtube?

YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction. YouTube will notify you when your YouTube account has been activated for lengthier uploads. YouTube playlists are limited to 5,000 videos, and YouTube Music playlists should be similarly restricted.

#### Standard Accounts Have A Time Limit

The 2 GB, file size limit is backed by a 15-minute maximum runtime restriction in YouTube's blog and Google's 2011 upload rules. All YouTube videos had to be under 10 minutes long until 2010, but on July 29, 2010, YouTube announced that the maximum video duration had been expanded to 15 minutes. According to the company, this was the most requested modification by YouTube viewers, and it's a natural move that takes full advantage of YouTube's new 2 GB size restriction.

#### What Are The Benefits Of Uploading Music Or A Song On Youtube?

* YouTube Music is a music-specific YouTube that allows users to watch and listen to a nearly infinite archive in a music discovery app. It will enable fans to find and engage with artists by making it easier for them to discover the range and diversity of music material on YouTube.
* Adding music to your video makes it more engaging and gives it a professional look.
* Background music is intended to fill quiet and create an atmosphere rather than to be carefully listened to. It also allows for the creation of a unique ambiance with a more or less subtle background to elicit distinct emotions in the mind of an audiovisual production's audience.
* Music can play a vital influence in the success of a video. The soundtrack can keep the viewer interested in the clip if the video itself is not entertaining.

**How Can I Utilise Music Lawfully In My Youtube Videos?**

If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you'll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube's music policy comes into play.

## How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?

At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn't commonplace, including a video can't hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you're working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.

The songs in YouTube's library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora's library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.

Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.

Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here's a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.

This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It's also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn't the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.

**Step 1:** The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio

Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to 'MEDIA' and then to the 'IMPORT' option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select 'Import Media Files' from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.

**Step 2:** Adding music to a timeline

Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the '+' sign ('Add to Project' will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.

**Step 3:** Make changes to the music file

By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.

**Step 4:** Export your work

After you've made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the 'EXPORT' tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.

#### Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?

YouTube's music library is relatively small. The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you're adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.
