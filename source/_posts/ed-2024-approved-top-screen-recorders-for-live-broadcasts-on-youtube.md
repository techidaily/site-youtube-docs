The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.

A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.

However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the **best YouTube Live screen recorders** you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders

The maximum resolution in which you can [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.

We have selected some of the best YouTube Live screen recorders that enable you to do much more than just record live streams. So, let's take a look at what they have to offer.

### 1. OBS Studio

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, Linux, macOS

The vast majority of live streams you can find on [Twitch](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and YouTube are made with OBS Studio, but besides broadcasting videos, the software also gives you access to screencasting tools. This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.

OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the [graphics card](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.

OBS Studio allows you to record videos from a variety of sources, which makes it a perfect option for capturing the content you share through YouTube Live since you can select a browser window you want to capture in just a few clicks. What’s more, this [open-source software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is equipped with basic video editing tools, which enables you to preview the video you recorded before publishing it, apply transitions between cuts, or perform basic color correction.

Check the detailed guide to [How to Record with OBS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2. XSplit

**Price:** $24.95 for a three-month license

**Compatibility:** Windows

This is yet another broadcasting software that is equipped with powerful screen recording tools. Setting up a new screencasting session with XSplit is a simple and intuitive process that is not going to take much more than a few moments of your time.

All you need to do is define a workspace, then pick the preferred resolution and frame rate. The software allows you to capture screens in [4K resolution](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and at 60 fps, but it also offers a variety of resolution and frame rate options so that you can choose the one that best fits your needs. Furthermore, you can record the computer audio, which enables you to capture the live stream’s audio in excellent quality. Besides YouTube Live, XSplit can be used with [Zoom](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Skype, Google Hangouts, and numerous other live streaming and video calling apps.

### 3. Filmora

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $49.99/year

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are looking for a screen recorder that is stacked with powerful video editing features, then Filmora is a great option for you. Customizing a YouTube Live or any other screencasting session with this video editing software is easy, and you can choose the resolution, frame rate, or even if you want to show mouse clicks in the recording.

Capturing the webcam feed and the computer’s screen simultaneously is also an option, while you can also decide whether or not you want to record audio from a microphone, computer audio, or both at the same time.

What’s more Filmora lets you set up the maximum duration of a screen recording and you start, pause, resume or stop a screen recording session by using hotkeys. Once you are done recording the live stream you shared on YouTube, you can edit the footage you created before uploading it to your YouTube channel.

### 4. Wondershare DemoCreator

**Compatibility:** Windows

**Price:** Start from $9.99

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/democreator/download/)

DemoCreator is a recorder that focuses its overall user experience. It is able to easily record high-quality videos at up to 120 FPS (60 FPS for Mac) and allows you to simultaneously record both your screen and webcam. This software is incredibly user friendly and makes for an easy experience for new streamers. The dual recording makes it great for gamers who are also looking to film their reactions.

### 5. CloudApp

**Price:** Free, $10 per month for an individual user

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome

Starting a new screen capturing session with the CloudApp requires you to just specify the portion of the screen you want to capture and hit the record button. Moreover, you can choose if you want to record with or without a webcam and you have the option to enable or disable the audio recording option.

However, you can only create 90-second screen recordings with the free version of the CloudApp and you cannot set resolution or frame rate of the recording. That’s why you need to upgrade to the Pro version if you want to use it to record live streams on YouTube. The Pro subscription model also grants you access to basic video editing tools and a variety of file sharing options. In addition, CloudApp lets you create and annotate still images and GIFs, which makes it a great option for digital marketers.

### 6. Techsmith Camtasia

**Price:** Free trial, $269.05 one-time fee

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

You don’t need years of video editing experience to start a new screen recording session in Camtasia. In fact, you just have to click on the Record button that is located in the software’s tool panel and then customize the settings.

Camtasia lets you choose if you want to record the full screen or just a selected portion of the screen or decide if you want to switch the webcam or the microphone off. You should make sure that the System Audio feature is enabled in order to record the sound of the live stream you’re sharing on YouTube. Pausing or stopping a screencasting session requires you to either click on the appropriate buttons or use the keyboard-based hotkeys. After you are done recording a live stream you can edit the footage using Camtasia’s video editing tools.

### 7. ScreenRec

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Recording any live stream or TV show you play on your computer with ScreenRec is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few clicks. Simply drag the mouse cursor over the area you want to record, then hit the Record button when you are ready and ScreenRec will start capturing the computer screen.

Once the screencasting session is completed you will get a sharable link that can be embedded to a website or used to save an MP4 file on your hard drive. Furthermore, ScreenRec is equipped with analytics tools that show you how many views your videos attracted or for how long each visitor watched them. All of these features make ScreenRec an excellent option for anyone who wants to record a live stream on YouTube or any other on-screen activity.

### 8. Flashback Express

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

Flashback Express is a simple screen recorder that lets you create high-res videos effortlessly. Setting up a new screencasting session requires you to just specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose whether or not you want to record the webcam feed and hit the Record button.

There are no restrictions in terms of the duration of screen recordings you can make with Flashback Express and the software doesn’t watermark the video you create.

However, you can only save the files in MP4, AVI, or WMW formats and you cannot adjust the video’s frame rate or resolution. What’s more, editing videos or applying effects with Flashback Express isn’t possible and you must upgrade to FlashBack Pro if you want to edit the live streams you broadcast on YouTube.

This piece of software is user friendly, but it doesn’t have as many features as other products on the market. Having said that, it is still an excellent tool that will help you live stream gameplay easily. Although it doesn’t come with built-in video editing software, it is possible to download another program to do this for you (i.e. Filmora). Flashback Express has the ability to record through your headset or microphone as well.

### 9. VLC

 **Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, Linux, Windows

This is an iconic media player that became famous for its versatility and support for nearly all video file formats. Besides being one of the [best media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created, VLC is also equipped with screen recording and video editing tools.

In order to start a new [screencasting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) session, you will have to go to the Media menu and then select the Open Capture Device option. Once the new window pops up on the screen you should change the Capture Mode to Desktop and then adjust the frame rate in accordance with your needs.

Click on the Play button, and then hit the Record button after the screen recording window appears on the screen. You can only record the entire screen with VLC, since customizing the recording area isn’t an option, and all your files will be captured in the RAW format which means that you may have to resize them before you upload them to YouTube.

### 10. Screencast-o-matic

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $1.65 per month

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

As its name suggests, this software product makes the screen recording process almost automatic. You can choose if you want to record an entire screen or just a window you selected. In addition, Screencast-o-matic lets you record the desktop and webcam footage at the same time, and you can even zoom in while the screencasting session is still in progress.

The free version of the software offers only a basic set of features that doesn’t include the option to record system audio. This means that you have to opt for one of the available subscription models if you want to record your live streams on YouTube with Screencast-o-matic. What’s more, you will be to create videos that are longer than 15 minutes, create recordings without watermarks or add music to your recordings if you opt for Deluxe or Premiere pricing options.

### 11. QuickTime Player

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Mac users who want to record content that is broadcasted via YouTube Live can do so without having to install a third-party app. Apple ceased the support for the Windows-based version of QuickTime Player in 2016 and PC users can only capture their screens with this software if they have some of its earlier versions.

In order to start a new screen recording session in QuickTime Player, you just have to go to the File menu and select the New Screen Recording option. The Screen Recording window where you can choose if you want to record audio or show mouse click in the recording will pop up on the screen. QuickTime Player lets you choose if you want to capture the entire screen or just a portion of it, and you can click on the Record button to start a new screencasting session. In order to save a video file you created, you just have to go to the File menu and pick the Save option.
