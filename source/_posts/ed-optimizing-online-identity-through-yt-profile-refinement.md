 As the most important text in the YouTube video description, the text in the first line will appear both in the YouTube search result and the social media.

#### 2.Add helpful text to the description

 It is highly recommended to add additional relevant content to the video description to help audience to get to know you better.

Normally, you can add anything that is worth mentioning such as the equipment or software that you are using to make the video.
